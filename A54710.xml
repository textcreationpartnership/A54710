            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Daughters of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue are not ill diſtinguiſhed in their Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by an Ingenious Fiction, of their having been all three ſpoken in Paradiſe: That, firſt, when the eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was forbidden, God himſelf delivered that Command in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as the moſt Majeſtick Language, which ſeems to carry Authority in the very ſound: That next, when the Serpent enticed <hi>Eve</hi> to taſt it, he made uſe of the <hi>Italian,</hi> as moſt Perſwaſive, charming the Ear with the Muſical ſweetneſs of its Accents. And that laſtly, when <hi>Adam</hi> was called to Account for his Diſobedience, he confidently excuſed himſelf in <hi>French,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſmootheſt Phraſes, and fitteſt to diſguiſe Criminal Actions with fair Pretences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98258:3"/>Nor does this only expreſs the Nature of thoſe Languages, but alſo of thoſe ſeveral Nations, and of the Subjects, wherein their Writings do more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly excel all others. Thus the Amorous
<hi>French,</hi> brisk and adventurous in Enterprizes, quick in variety of Invention to frame ſurprizing Projects, and of a Ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſant Courtly Converſation, have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd all others in well-contrived and pleaſantly-diverting <hi>Romances.</hi> The Politick <hi>Italians,</hi> of a ſubtil penetrating Wit, to diſcern and obſerve the Intrigues of State; Jealous, and thereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive to ſearch into the grounds upon which they move, and Judicious in giving the Reaſons of them, have been remarakably Excellent in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Hiſtory. And the Grave <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are of a ſerious thoughtful Temper, fit for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Zealous in Religion, and extreamly Devout, are preferred before the others, for Books of Piety. Not that any of the three want Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Authors in all ſorts of Learning; but that the Genius of each being different, does help to the attaining of greater Perfection in thoſe particular Subjects.</p>
            <p>Our Youth, Manhood, and Old Age ſuit with the ſeveral Humours of thoſe three Nations; Men commonly in thoſe Seaſons of their Life being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to read Pieces of ſuch kinds, as are most agreeable to each. Now one of the first ſort ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been tranſlated out of <hi>French,</hi> and one of the ſecond out of <hi>Italian,</hi> by the ſame Perſon; the former (at the deſire of a great Lord) in his younger days; the other (at the Command of a<pb facs="tcp:98258:3"/>great King) in his riper Years; He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moved by a far greater Soveraign, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome of his declining time in Tranſlating one of the third and beſt ſort out of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that he might not give a worſe Account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remainder of that Precious Talent, but endeavour to make it ſome way uſeful to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>When he firſt had that Deſign, this Book was given him by the
<hi>Conde de Molina</hi> (then <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Embaſſador here) with great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a late Piece highly eſteemed amongst them, and he had the more hope it might prove worthy of his Pains, becauſe he had ſeen ſome other things of the ſame Author, (<hi>viz. John de Palafox &amp; Mendoza,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſma</hi>) and particularly a Letter, wherein he relates the hard Perſecution he had ſuffered by the Jeſuites, while he was Biſhop of <hi>Angelopolis</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By having read ſeveral of their Works, he found that the beſt of them are not free from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Monkiſh Stories, and Legendary Miracles, and could not but wonder at ſuch a mixture of Truths and Forgeries from the ſame Pens, comparing them to the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Figgs, whereof the good were very good, but the bad ſo bad, as not fit to be eaten; at leaſt not by us in this Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Climate, whither, it is hoped, ſuch unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Fruits ſhall never be tranſplanted any more. Yet having ſeen ſeveral of thoſe Books ſo well purged, as to be ſafely read by the ſtricteſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; He thought it would be no hard matter
<pb facs="tcp:98258:4"/>to do the like with this. And being pleaſed with the Subject, as agreeing with his Intentions; and the three parts of this <hi>Spiritual Year</hi> ſuiting alſo with the different Ages of our Life, he reſolved to follow the Apoſtle's Advice, <hi>To try all things, and to hold faſt only that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Firſt Part he met with little but what might well enough be made fit for one of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to read; but in the ſecond Part he found it neceſſary to make ſuch wide Gaps in ſeveral of the Diſcourſes, that he feared it would paſs his Skill to make them up ſo, as to keep the Author's Order in his ſeveral Months and Weeks; yet he attempted by borrowing from other Authors of that Nation, and from ſome of our own, to fill up thoſe Breaches, and to keep to the Author's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, with the ſame good intention and deſire to bring ſinners to Repentance, and to ſave their Souls. And yet after he had done all, he had not ſo good an Opinion of his own performance, (being but a Lay-man) as to think he had made the Work Correct enough to be publiſhed with hope of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting amongst us the ſame Pious Deſign, which the Original aimed at.</p>
            <p>However, having reap'd much benefit himſelf by ſpending ſo many Hours in ſuch a ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (which had the greater Power upon him by forcing him to a very attentive Conſideration of the buſineſs he was about, to the end he might rightly underſtand, and render it into
<hi>Engliſh</hi>) he purſued the Work till he had quite gone through it, which he did ſome Years ago, but has kept it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately<pb facs="tcp:98258:4"/>by him ever ſince for his own Uſe; till by chance a Pious Divine of our Church found him looking over ſome pieces of it, which, when he had been allowed the liberty to peruſe, he judged it might be made capable of doing good in the World, and thereupon it was freely given up into his hands to be altered, as he ſhould think moſt expedient to that end, and to be ſupplied in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever part he ſhould ſtill find it defective.</p>
            <p>By his Care and labour it comes forth at length, in ſuch a manner, he hopes, as may be available to promote the Spiritual good of Men, to perſwade them to the ſerious Practice of Religion and Piety, and to get them poſſeſs'd with a Spirit of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; which is the ſole end of his endeavours, and indeed is a thing which cannot be proſecuted with too much earneſtneſs in this luke-warm Age, when there appears almoſt in every place a moſt diſmal face of Indevotion, and a general decay of Chriſtian Piety, univerſally extending it ſelf through all places and orders of Men; which ſad and lamentable Evil, as it is the deſire of all good Men, as far as in them lies, to remedy; ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves an impartial and diligent peruſal of this and ſuch-like Spiritual Treatiſes, will, by the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, be Inſtrumental to the producing of that bleſſed effect. He found by reading this Book, that in it were laid down the moſt profitable and uſeful Inſtructions, the moſt affecting and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Arguments to allure to the Service of God, and the moſt ſolid and ſubſtantial Nouriſhment, that can be adminiſtred to Souls: And this gave him<pb facs="tcp:98258:5"/>Encouragment to undergo the pleaſing Trouble of preparing it for a Publick Reading. Which being effected, his hearty Prayers to Almighty God are, that his Endeavours may have their deſired influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Hearts and Minds of all that ſhall vouchſafe to peruſe them; and that that Devout and Heavenly Spirit may in ſome meaſure be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them, whereby the <hi>Spiritual Author</hi> of this <hi>Spiritual Year</hi> was acted, in Deſigning and Perfecting ſo Divine and Profitable a Work.</p>

            <head>THE Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Piece is to draw Souls to the ſerious Conſideration of Eternity, to move their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Love of Heavenly things, and to bring them to a Contempt of thoſe that are Temporal and tranſitory. In it they will ſee much of what is treated at large in divers Spiritual Books, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what lies diſperſed in them, ſummed up in this one; not with that Spirit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherewith thoſe Authors wrote, but with equal deſire for the good of Souls.</p>
            <p>Indeed that, which we are able to do, is nothing, in reſpect of what God does by that Grace, which he hath tyed to the Miniſtry; for without all doubt, 'tis He that does all; He that moves all, He that directs all, He that amends all, and brings all to Perfection. Though St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Veſſel of Election, full of the Spirit, and might have had as great confidence in himſelf, as any other Apoſtle, yet this made him ſay, That his Planting was nothing, and his Watering nothing, but that it was God that gave the Increaſe.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:98258:6"/>However, it much animates the Labourers of the Goſpel in the Spiritual Work, to find that it often happens to them, as it does to Husband-men, who ſcatter their Seed on their Land with perfect heedleſneſs, part of it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beſide, and part being thrown from them with an uncertain direction, only with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to fill the Field with Seed; and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home afterwards to take their reſt, God while they are aſleep ſends Rain upon the Inheritance, moiſtens the Earth, diſpoſes the Seed, tempers the Heat, ſeaſons the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, makes it rot, revive, and riſe again, ſo that even in Corruption it takes Root, grows up, and brings forth the full Ear. What did the Sower more, than caſt away the Seed from him, as if he regarded it not? And yet it ſprings up, and gives an abundant increaſe. All that he did was to prepare the Matter, that God might work the Miracle, which (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays) is only little in Man's Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, becauſe he ſees God work it ſo often.</p>
            <p>This hope encourages me to ſcatter the Seeds of the Divine Word into the Hearts of the Faithful; truſting that God (who is the Worker of all that we do) will give his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, his Grace, and Power, to the end that the Fruit may be multiplied; which Effect in the Parable of the Sower <hi>his Divine Majeſty</hi> intimates, he uſeth to produce in thoſe Souls, who receive it with Attention, and with a pious holy Affection; it taking Root in them, as in a fertile Soil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98258:6"/>But it may be ſome will ſay, there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo many Books of Devout Meditations, that this might well have been ſpared; they being ſo Holy and Spiritual, and this not ſo, being written by ſo wretched a ſinner as I am. To this I anſwer, that though all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be queſtioned, why they make Spiritual Treatiſes, ſince there are ſo many; yet that account ought not to be demanded from Biſhops, ſince it is a thing as proper to their Miniſtry, to Write, to Teach, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, as the very Name of a Paſtor. And in that Work, 'tis lawful for a Prelate to Teach not only Opportunely, but in a manner Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely; as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> teaches his Diſciple <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> who was Biſhop of
<hi>Epheſus.</hi> Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine; that is, by Sermons, by Writing, by Converſing, and by Example.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>We Biſhops</hi> ought ever to fear the contrary Cenſure and Queſtion; Why do ye not write Spiritual Books? And this being the more dreadful Cenſure, we ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that which we have leaſt need to fear, and to avoid that, which can moſt condemn us. Moreover
'tis a very affected and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Complaint of the Politick Cenſurer, who is troubled, that ſo many Spiritual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes come forth into the World; for God can never be too much praiſed thereby, nor can Evangelical Counſels be too often repeated, nor Diſcourſes that aim at the Salvation of<pb facs="tcp:98258:7"/>Souls be too frequent, though conſiſting of one ſame Matter. To ſay the truth, we have ſeen nothing elſe in the Church of God, from the time that <hi>His Divine Majeſty</hi> ſettled it with his Blood, but this Succeſſion of Doctrine, which has accompanied that of thoſe ſame Miniſters, whom by their Vocation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Abilities, he called and appointed for Maſters of Chriſtian Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Four Evangeliſts</hi> wrote thoſe four Books, which contain all the Treaſures of Grace, in the Life and Death of our Saviour; yet St. <hi>John</hi> did not forbear to write his three Epiſtles, and the
<hi>Revelation;</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Acts of the Apoſtles, St.
<hi>Peter</hi> two Epiſtles, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> fourteen; St.
<hi>James</hi> one, St. <hi>Jude</hi> another; and their Diſciples,
<hi>Ignatius, Polycarp,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did alſo write, though they might have contented themſelves with what the Apoſtles had done, who were the General Miniſters and Teachers of the Faith.</p>
            <p>After theſe ſucceed the Doctors of the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latine</hi> Churches, who filled the World with Writings, without any prejudice to thoſe; or rather proceeding upon the ſame Doctrine, and uſing it according to their purpoſe, have enlightened and enriched the Church, to the great profit and comfort of Souls. That Book of the Imitation of Chriſt, made by <hi>Thomas a Kempis,</hi> which ſome call the Contempt of the World, and others, The Chriſtian Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; though it be a very little one, is yet ſo full of weight, that thoſe other Spiritual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
<pb facs="tcp:98258:7"/>which have been written ſince, might ſeem ſuperfluous; yet for all that the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Lewis de Granada</hi> having tranſlated and incorporated it into his Meditations, with thoſe of another excellent Author, which are very Heavenly both in their Spirit, Style, and Matter; did not only make others after them, but wrote alſo the <hi>Guide of Sinners,</hi> which has reduced, converted, and guided ſo many; as likewiſe the <hi>Symbol of the Faith,</hi> and ſeveral other moſt Profitable Treatiſes; beſides num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs other Spiritual Men, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſince, and are ſtill Writing without any harm to the World, by the repetition of the Churches Doctrine in ſo many ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For the Pens of Writers accommodate themſelves to our Humane condition, which in length of Time and variety of Ages ſeems to alter its taſt; and even that, which is good, had need to be ſeaſoned after ſuch a manner, that Men may be ſpoken to in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Thus there is no fault to be found, that there are ſo many Spiritual Books in the World; the pity would be, if they ſhould be wanting: As no body complains of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if there be much pure Silver Coin current in a Kingdom; that, which might be cenſured, is, if there were great ſcarcity of that, and great abundance of Copper Money. If it ſhould be ſaid, Why are there ſo many ſmutty Plays, looſe Romances, prophane Poeſies, abuſive Satyrs, and Atheiſtical Pamphlets, with others of that kind, which do unſpeakable<pb facs="tcp:98258:8"/>Miſchief, and at the beſt ſerve only for a vain and unneceſſary Divertiſement? This indeed were too juſt a Complaint, too reaſonable an occaſion of Cenſure, and it is much to be wiſhed, that effectual care were taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Publiſhing of ſuch, and to ſuppreſs many of thoſe that are already abroad.</p>
            <p>It is probable many will diſlike the ſhortneſs of my Style, and ſay, that it had been better, if I had dilated my Diſcourſe into larger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as many very Learned and Spiritual Men have done in other Treatiſes. To this I Anſwer, that though I be ſhort and conciſe, I have endeavoured to make it clear, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and comprehenſive, and not to let the Brevity of it take away the force of Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Endeavour of this hath been mine, but the attaining and effecting it muſt be from God.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, I have alſo divided it by Months, Weeks, and other ſhorter Paragraphs, to the end that thoſe, that read it, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Nouriſhment cut into ſmaller Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; eſpecially in the beginning, where I have been briefer, becauſe the Points there treated of are harſh and unpleaſing, like a Purgative Medicine, which being very bitter, is hard to be gotten down in a great Potion; but is more eaſily ſwallowed, when it is made up into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pills. My Prayer is they may work to the driving out of ſin, and to the preparing of their hearts for thoſe comfortable Cordials, that are adminiſtred more ſeaſonably after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98258:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>I Adviſe therefore all thoſe, that ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to read this Book, that they would do it with great leiſure and conſideration, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may obtain that Spiritual Profit I wiſh them; and that they would by little and little drink the Spiritual Water of this Doctrine, Meditating and Contemplating upon it, and often making pauſes, after the manner of Birds, who lift up their head at every drop they drink, as if it were to give thanks for that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and laſtly, that they would lift up their Hearts and Thoughts to God in an attentive Conſideration of every one of thoſe Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I propoſe unto them.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, I have ſometimes permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Style to have a certain Chyme or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to imprint them the deeper in their Memory, that from thence they may ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts; to the end, that enlightening and warming them in the love of Heavenly things, they may remain fixed in them for ever. For as our Common Proverbs ſtick more eaſily in the Imagination, when Cuſtom has brought them into it; ſo thoſe ſhort Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, and inward Inſtructions of Souls do by that means produce more benefit: And I have choſen rather to ſuffer that Imperfection in my Style, than to venture loſing the fruit of my deſire.</p>
            <p>The Fathers, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>African</hi> Church, were much accuſtomed to this way of Writing; as St. <hi>Auſtin, Fulgentius, Valerius Maximus,</hi> and others; nay, even <hi>Leo the Great,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98258:9"/>and <hi>Petrus Chryſologus,</hi> though <hi>Latines</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have ſomething of it. For as all of them buſied themſelves to perſwade Souls to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo, it being needful for that end to leave that imprinted in the outward, which they would have to be fixed in the inward Powers and Faculties, they ſought the moſt Effectual means, though it was not the moſt Elegant and perfect way of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (whom he that follows in the Church of God, and imitates both in his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner of expreſſing it, may be ſure not to do amiſs) uſes this very frequently, as may be ſeen in his fourteenth Sermon <hi>de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis,</hi> where ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he ſays, <hi>Portabat Chriſtus Perſecutorem, ut faceret Eccleſiae Doctorem; occiſus agnus à lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, &amp; faciens agnos de lupis; mane rapientem, &amp; ad veſperam praedam dividentem.</hi> And in his thirteenth Sermon, <hi>de Tempore,</hi> ſpeaking of our Saviour, he has theſe words. <hi>O omnipotentia naſcentis! O magnificentia de Coelo deſcendentis! adhuc in utero portabatur, &amp; ex utero Matris à Joanne Baptiſta ſalutabatur, &amp; à Simeone ſene famoſo, annoſo, probato, coronato, agnoſcebatur; differebatur exire de ſeculo, ut videret natum, per quem conditum eſt ſeculum; Innovatus in aetate, qui plenus erat pietate.</hi> And the like in many other places.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly this Book may alſo be diſliked by ſome, for not having any of thoſe points in it, that relate to Viſions and Revelations; which are Favours <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:98258:9"/>communicate to Devout Souls: But my Intention is to give Men a clear, plain, and ſubſtantial Nouriſhment, which may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, conſtant, and ſecure; to put them upon the Exerciſe of Vertues, and to give them an Averſion to the Vices that are contrary unto them; and at the ſame time both to perſwade and enlighten them in the Principal Myſteries of Faith, and not to enter into more abſtruſe and extatick Diſcourſes; for ſince things are chiefly governed by Rules, and the Infallible Rules are, to flie from evil, and to do good, to ſeek Peace, and enſue it, (as the
<hi>Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> ſaith) and ſince this depends wholly upon the Exerciſe of a Chriſtian Life, in believing and doing according to God's Will revealed in his Word; my deſire has been to feed Men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with common Food, and to give them the plain Rules and Foundation of the inward Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving thoſe particular and extraordinary things, which may ſometimes be felt by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Souls, to other Treatiſes and Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who Diſcourſe upon thoſe Subjects with great light and exactneſs. I content my ſelf, that they ſhould ſtir up themſelves by the Reading of this Book, to endeavour to ſerve, to love, and to pleaſe God in the Exerciſe of Chriſtian Vertues, by frequent and Devout Prayer; that they ſhould often conſider theſe Inſtructions, and frame their Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners according to them, making that their whole Employment: And though they obtain no higher favour of God, than to keep his<pb facs="tcp:98258:10"/>Commandments, and to follow his ſweet and delightful Counſels, as far as their Frailty can permit; they need neither deſire, nor trouble themſelves for more; and if <hi>God</hi> ſhall pleaſe to give them any thing beyond that, let them decline it with Humility, or receive it with Reverence, and preſerve it with Fear, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things with reſignation, and the Counſel of their Spiritual Guide; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations whereby we are to be ſaved, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready revealed to the Church, and for the reſt, though they may be profitable, yet they are not neceſſary to my Deſign.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I offer this Work, ſuch as it is, (full, I confeſs, of Imperfections) to all that are deſirous to improve, and go forward in the Spiritual Life, with a moſt affectionate deſire of their good; earneſtly exhorting them to the principal end, which the whole aims at; namely, to know, how much earthly tranſitory things ought to be deſpiſed, and therefore to flie from Vices, to avoid Worldly Delights, and to embrace thoſe which are Heavenly and Eternal; to practiſe the Vertues, to frequent the Sacrament, to Pray earneſtly, and often; and finally, to labour, and take pains in the <hi>Kingdom of Grace,</hi> that they may come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<hi>God</hi> eternally in the <hi>Kingdom of Glory.</hi>

                  <head>The Firſt WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Weakneſs of Humane Nature.</head>
                  <p>HEAR, Son, the Inſtruction of thy Father, and learn to fear God, who is thy true Father. Conſider thy beginning, if thou deſireſt to have a good ending. Look what thou art, and thou wilt ſee what thou ſhalt be. Know thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt know God. Behold thy ſelf, that thou mayeſt behold him; thou art blind from thy birth like the man in the Goſpel, and mayeſt recover thy ſight as he did by putting Clay upon thine eyes. That is the matter thou art made of, and it had remain'd Clay for ever, if the Spirit of God had not breathed<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98258:14"/>life into it. Thus thou ſeeſt what Humane Nature is, and that it ſpeaks nothing but weakneſs and frailty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would'ſt thou ſee how ſtrong it is? Look how long it ſtood. Man being created in Innocence, ſcarce continu'd ſo for a few days; ſome ſay, hardly a few hours. His Nature was ſo perfect, and ſo ſtrong that it was able to deſtroy it ſelf, and without any inward weakneſs, it yielded (in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>) to an outward Enemy. What is it like to be, now that it is ſick and mortally wounded, ſince it ruined it ſelf, when it was ſound and healthful? Man fell in Paradiſe in the midſt of Light; and now, unleſs he get aſſiſtance of the light of Grace by Prayer, what will become of him? And how ſhall he keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtanding in the midſt of ſo much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo many confuſions, as he has been ſubject to ever ſince he was baniſhed thence?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is our Nature, but a Veſſel of Paſſions and Miſeries; a ſeed-plot of Sins, and of Misfortunes? Conſider Man in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and thou ſhalt find him to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Corruption. Behold him in the darkneſs of his Mother's womb, and thou ſhalt find him a little lump of living filth. Behold him taken Captive before ever he was at liberty; and a Priſoner before he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Crime. His Body ſcarcely formed, and yet already ſhut up in a moſt obſcure Dungeon. Thus was he acquainted with darkneſs, before he ſaw any light; and came
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98258:14"/>headlong crying into the World, as an Omen of his precipitate Paſſions and future Miſeries. Yet alas, that Captivity which his Body ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in his Mother's Womb, is leſs to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, than the other which his Soul ſuffers in his Body.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Behold, that is a Captive, not only to corruption and filth, as the Body, for that were tolerable; but alſo to the loathſomneſs of ſin; created to an Original Servitude, and condemned to Troubles without number or meaſure. To begin to be, and to begin to be in Servitude, is in Man one and the ſame thing. We are all born Slaves of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, what have we then to be proud of? Only one Man exempted himſelf from this hard Servitude, for he was God: All the reſt fell; all the reſt are Tributaries without remedy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Man is born to ſuffer and to weep; he forces out his way by the ſtrait paſſages of Afflictions, Pangs, and Throws; cauſing them to his Mother, and ſometimes even her very Death. What kind of Creature is this, that cannot come to life, without hazarding to give, or to receive death? And who at the ſame time begins to live and to lament; being accuſtom'd to Tears, before he comes acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Laughter. But it is no wonder he ſhould weep at his Mother's feet for being born, ſeeing the miſeries that expect him in the World. The Body hath cauſe enough to bewail its innumerable pains, and the Soul its<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98258:15"/>innumerable ſins. Finally, Man is born the moſt feeble and helpleſs of all Creatures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of every thing, and needing the ſuccour of every body. He is kept alive by the Alms, Care, and Compaſſion of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; being utterly unable to help himſelf, and utterly uſeleſs to all others.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In this ſad condition, God's mercy ſteps in, and makes him His, by the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. He takes from him the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>gs of the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> and cloaths him with the Robe of Grace, making him the Adopted Son of God, by the blood of the Eternal Son of God. O! happy he, if his Fortune ended here; and if in this Holineſs and Innocency of Childhood, he might paſs from Grace to Glory! But no; alas, he is not ſo happy; for he grows up, either to a greater Reward, or to harder Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. The light of Reaſon no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to glimmer in him, but preſently his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite ruſhes forth to oppoſe it; and that being commonly ſtrong and powerful, drags the other after it, (becauſe it is weaken'd by the firſt fall) unleſs it be aſſiſted by God's Grace. His Affections take birth with his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with them his Paſſions gather ſtrength; theſe grow, and daily darken his Reaſon; he lives a painful and vexatious life, in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflict, ſometimes falling, ſometimes get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up again, and very often totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and willingly yielding up the Victory. His Life, whilſt an Infant, is meer impotence; whilſt a Child, ignorance; whilſt a Youth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98258:15"/>danger; whilſt a Man, care; when Old, weakneſs, pain, and ſorrow; and his paſſage through all theſe Ages, is frailty, ſin, and folly. In ſhort, he lives ſuch a life, that Death uſes ſometimes to be his Wiſh, often his Refuge, and always the great Remedy of his Miſeries. This is the external Man, therefore do thou uſe thy endeavours to become an internal Man. Conquer Nature, by the help of Grace; thy Appetite, by that of Reaſon; the Delights of the Fleſh, by Mortification; the Deceits of the World, by Prayer; and even Death it ſelf, by a Religious Life.</p>

               <div n="2" type="week">
                  <head>The Second WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Frailty of Man, and of the Miſeries of his Body.</head>
                  <p>THis is the Nature of Man in general; Look now in particular upon the Body, that groſs and viſible part of our frailty. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith not, that man's Body hath ſome miſeries and troubles, but that he is of few days, and full of troubles. Would'ſt thou ſee it? They are ſo many, that they commonly break forth, becauſe they cannot be contained within him; and ever and anon that which afflicts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, diſcovers it ſelf outwardly in boyls<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98258:16"/>and bliſters, in ſwellings and diſcolourings of the skin. The Year hath fewer days, than there be ways of dying ſuddenly; and can any body live in ſo ſtupid a Lethargy, as not ſo much as to dream of an Eternal Life? The Year, and even our Life, hath fewer hours than there be Mortal Diſeaſes in the Body, (as Naturaliſts affirm) and can any one live forgetful of his Soul? We may wonder how life can continue in the Body, having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gates and Windows to get out at? How is it poſſible that the four Humours, which are Enemies to one another, ſhould agree and laſt together in ſo ſtrait, ſo narrow, and ſo obſcure a place as is man's Body? Yet they do not agree, but with a moſt obſtinate ſtrife and conteſt, they do diſorder and diſcompoſe our life. What is the Body, but a falſe and ſeeming Friend to the Soul, yet in truth, its certain and deadly Enemy? What is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but a Veſſel of Poyſon, which to day is not perceived, yet kills to morrow? What is the Body, but a heap of loathſomneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? What is it but a living deceit, which yet continually undeceives us, if we would be undeceived; and a ſecurity in appearance, but a conſtant infelicity? Whilſt it is in Health, it cheats us, and never ſpeaks truth but in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo long as it lives, it is a lye; and never tells truth, till it be dead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our life is nothing but death in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and when it has made an end of acting its part, the Mask is pull'd off. The moſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98258:16"/>beautiful Body carries that within it, which were ſufficient to make it eternally fly from it ſelf, if it were poſſible ſo to do. It is full of filth and corruption, ſo loathſome, and ſo nauſeous, that it is a ſcandal but to name them. It is a ſource of Uncleanneſs, and the wretched dwelling of Impurities, which are ſo numerous, that it was neceſſary to make many Common Sewers for them to run out at, becauſe there was not room enough for them within. The Body is ſo frail, that every thing hath a powerful Juriſdiction over it; a little duſt choaks it, a little fire conſumes it, a little water drowns it, and even a blaſt of air deſtroys it. Some have been ſeen to dye with Laughter, others have been killed with Joy; one is drown'd with a draught of Milk, and another choaked with a Hair; nay, even a man's own breath, meeting with his own breath, hath made an end of him with a Heicough. In concluſion, man's Body is the death of his very life; can any thing be more frail and weak? Can any thing be more death? Or can any thing leſs deſerve the name of life?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O the deceit of Mortals, that can be cheated with this Dunghill! This groſs, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and miſerable part of us, drags all the World Captive after it. Shall we ſerve and pamper ſo vile, and ſo baſe an Enemy? Shall we ſweat and take ſuch pains for its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleaſures?</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98258:17"/>4. No, let us not do ſo. Uſe thy Body as a Subject, and let the Soul live as the Prince Ruling in it. Let the better part of thee Command, and the meaner Obey: Let Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon take the Empire, and let thy Appetite ſerve as a ſubdued Vaſſal. Let Grace rule thy Reaſon, and then let Reaſon be the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of thy Soul, that it may Govern thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Monarchy; in Holineſs towards God, and in Righteouſneſs toward Man.</p>

                  <head>The Third WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Miſeries and Paſſions of the Soul.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT take heed how thou ſuffereſt thy Soul to Command, unleſs it be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Command of God; for alas, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Soul without its hazards. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries thereof are not leſs, but greater, except it be govern'd by the Creator of both Body and Soul. The Rational Soul was in its firſt beginnings ſound and ſtrong; it became wounded by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and though cur'd by Grace in Baptiſm, yet the ſeed and inciter of ſin ſtill remains. The Scar of that Wound is not yet worn out; and there ſtill remains a hard Exerciſe and Conflict of our Nature, which is always rebellious till Grace bring it<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98258:17"/>to ſubjection. Our fleſhly Appetite common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governs and draws our Reaſon after it; the Paſſions live triumphing in our Souls, and keep the Vertues in Captivity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What miſchiefs have been acted by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that owe not their Original to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Soul? What does not the Devil owe to thoſe fomenters of Crimes, and to thoſe Parents of ſo many miſeries? What Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or what Folly is there in the World, that is not derived from the ſame ſource? Behold the Cities and Kingdoms which man's Paſſions have ſet on fire, and deſtroy'd: Behold the Cruelties, Murders, Adulteries, Robberies, and other Abominations. Behold Mortals concurring to haſten their mortality, and thinking themſelves ruined, if they cannot ruine one another. All theſe, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other miſchiefs, are due to the Paſſions of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Wars, the Sieges, the Battails, and the Victories, by which men ſo carefully ſeek the ways to deſtroy one another, proceed from them. Man's Nature being ſo blind, as to call that Victory, Happineſs, and Triumph, which is the undoing, the conſuming, and the extirpation of it ſelf. Conſider thoſe neceſſary Harms, thoſe unavoidable Misfortunes, thoſe bloody Cruelties, the Killings, Robbings, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all thoſe things which ſo many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without; and by this thou ſeeſt what Humane Nature is.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98258:18"/>4. He that poyſon'd the Waters on purpoſe that whole Nations and Kingdoms might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by them; He that envenomed the Duſt, whereby numberleſs Perſons died infected; He that fed his Horſes with the fleſh of his Gueſts; He that wiſhed the whole Empire had but one Neck, that he might cut it off at one ſtroke; He that in a rage cut the Throats of thouſands of his Neighbours; The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Faith, that by wild Beaſts, and by their own Cruelty, fiercer than that of wild Beaſts, tore in pieces and deſtroyed ſo many juſt and holy men; ſo many innocent Martyrs and Confeſſors: All theſe were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to thoſe Villanies by their Paſſions. In concluſion, whatever horrid Wickedneſs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hainous Crime man hath or ſhall commit, proceed all from the Paſſions of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. O how much greater are the ruines of Souls than thoſe of Bodies! The Body is brutiſh, it obeys and does not diſcourſe; but the Soul hath the light of Underſtanding, which ſhould direct, govern, and preſerve the Body; and yet it kindles, enflames, and deſtroys the Body, dragging it along with it ſelf to utter Perdition.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What do we ſee in this World, but enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Soul, which the Body often pays for upon the Gibbet or the Scaffold? The Whip, the Rope, the Hatcher, the Galleys, Baniſhment, Impriſonment, and many more Penalties of the Body are not ſufficient for that multitude of wickedneſſes which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98258:18"/>by the Soul. It is for the Soul's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences ſuch multitude of Bodies are puniſhed; and yet the number of thoſe Perſons whoſe Crimes are pardon'd, or not known, doth far exceed that of thoſe that ſuffer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Would'ſt thou know how great the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Soul and of its Paſſions are? Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it by the effects. They extinguiſh the Light of Natural Reaſon in it, and make it to become brutiſh and unnatural; nay, bruit Beaſts have the advantage in very many things over paſſionate Men. See how temperate they are in compariſon of Men; When did the ſincerity of Men equal that of the Dove? When their Prudence reach that of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? It is manifeſt, never; ſince the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God bids us to be wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves. When did the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Man equal that of the Ant? It is manifeſt, never; ſince the Holy Spirit ſends the improvident Perſon to learn of the Ant. When did his Meekneſs equal that of the Lamb? It is manifeſt, never; ſince the Baptiſt gives that ſweet Title of the Lamb, to the Redeemer of the World.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When was there ever ſeen ſo many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and Slaughters amongſt Beaſts, as we ſee daily amongſt Men? Who ever ſaw Troops of Lions making War againſt other Lions? Of Wolves againſt other Wolves? Or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wild Beaſts againſt thoſe of their own kind? Have our Fields ever had Armies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of irrational Creatures? Only Man is a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98258:19"/>Beaſt to his own kind; Man is a Wolf to Man; nay, which is worſe, Man is a Man to Man; for by what more reproachful name can he be called? ſince men make ſuch Wars as the fierceſt of Beaſts never do.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When do Beaſts practice that Senſuality and Uncleanneſs which Men are guilty of? They content themſelves at certain times to pay that debt to Nature, which conſerves their Kind. When did irrational Nature ſeek to ſatisfie the Appetites of Gluttony? How ſimple is their Diet! how frugal! how healthful, and how natural! This is the life of Beaſts, while we ſet our wits on work to procure our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by our Food; and our death by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exceſſes in the nouriſhment of our life.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Free our Souls, O Lord, from Paſſions, which make them veryer Beaſts than the Beaſts themſelves. And what are we, Lord, if thou leaveſt us without the ſupport of thy power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand! O how we abuſe thoſe admirable Gifts which thou ſo graciouſly beſtoweſt upon us! We extinguiſh the light of Reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, we baniſh truth and goodneſs from us, and transform our ſelves into wild Beaſts, or worſe, if we forſake thy Law, and give our ſelves up to the obedience of our own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Miſeries and Sins of each Man in particular.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THeſe are, the Miſeries of our Nature lightly and briefly expreſſed; but what kind of ones, and how many are they in each one of us individuals, ſeeing they are ſo great, and ſo conſiderable in their Root? If the Tree be ſo bitter, what bitterneſs muſt be in the Fruit? How blind are we, O God, if we do not ſee that which is ſo near us! How blind are we, if we do not ſee what we are our ſelves! How wretched, if ſuch innumerable Miſeries do not enlighten us to ſeek for Mercy! How unworthy, if we do not bewail the Sins we daily commit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let every one well conſider himſelf, and he ſhall ſee what is in himſelf. Let each of us turn the Eye of his Mind to behold himſelf within; Let each of us put our hand in our boſom; and he will draw it out full of Leproſie. If the juſt Man falls ſeven times a day (or rather ſeventy times ſeven) what ſhall I do that am unjuſt and wicked? Do not judge of this, or meaſure it by others, but judge of it and meaſure it by thy ſelf and me.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98258:20"/>3. Scarce did the Light of natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe begin to ſhine in my Child-hood, when I embraced Evil, it being my Duty to have embraced Good. My Reaſon increas'd with my Age, but my Paſſion increaſed much faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it. What a grief, what a pity, to ſee Reaſon baniſhed from a Man's Soul by Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! That being ſet between Evil and Good, my Soul ſhould fly from Good to Evil! Woe is me, how ſoon I loſt the Robe of Grace! How ſoon I made my ſelf an infamous Slave of Sin! How ſoon its ſnares and nets intangled me! How ſoon its darkneſs obſcur'd all my light! How early I began to grow worſe, and to haſten that approaching Night! How early I forſook the Banner of the Redeemer of Souls, and flying from the City of God to that of my beaſtly Appetite, I quitted the Holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to take up my dwelling in
<hi>Babylon!</hi> How late I recover'd thee, O ſweet Jeſus of my Life! How late I know the way to ſerve thee, having ſo early known the way to offend thee! Slow have I been to follow thee, O my Jeſus; but very haſty to perſecute thee. Who can ſuffer this? This ſlowneſs, and that haſte. Crucifie my Soul, O Lord, and I will bewail them both eternally in my Life, till I ſee thee in the Life eternal by my death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How long did I go as a loſt and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son, flying from my heavenly Father that ſought me! How long like a wandring Sheep, flying from my Shepherd that ran after me!<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98258:20"/>How long did I go aſtray in the venemous Paſture of worldly Vices, taking Poyſon and Death to be my nouriſhment! I embraced my Deceits and my Undoings, being fond of that which killed me, Blindly ſtumbling, I followed after Vanity, and in a bold folly, I hunted after my own deſtruction. Who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me and brought me back when I was loſt, laying me gently upon his Shoulders? Who was that divine <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that took care of me, the Man full of Wounds, and that lay half dead as I was going from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> Who but thou, O my Jeſus, who wert more wounded by thy Love for Man, then I by the Love of my Sins? Who but thou ſweet Jeſus that wert more ready to lay down thy Life for me, then I was to have my Life ſaved by thee?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For me to be loſt and wicked and wretched, (O eternal Glory) is natural to me and to my Vices; that being properly of my own Stock: but for thee, who art infinitely good, to ſeek after him that was loſt, and wicked, and wretched (thy infinite Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring rather that thou ſhould'ſt deſtroy then ſave ſuch a Perſon) is a Work that belongs only to thy unſpeakable Mercy, and to the Bowels of thy Compaſſion. Thine infinite Goodneſs, O my Jeſus, doth ſtill exceed my horrible wickedneſs; and look how vaſt the diſtance is between thee and me, between finite, and infinite: So vaſt is that between my ruine, and my remedy. Bleſſed be thou<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98258:21"/>my God, for though the one be great, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is unmeaſurable in greatneſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But, Oh, that being once found and cured by thy hand, I had never loſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee again! Oh, that I had but once coſt thee the Pains, the Sweat, the Blood, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the Death which thou paid'ſt for me! But Lord, I have often, nay numberleſs times crucified thee again.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Look not Lord upon my wickedneſs, but upon thine own goodneſs. To offend thee, though but once was a great Evil; but to do it ſo many thouſand times, is an Evil of the higheſt Magnitude. To offend by forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thee, before I was pardon'd, was very ill; ſince to forget thee is a very great Evil; but to offend thee after being pardon'd, is an ill beyond all ills, becauſe it is to be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and an Enemy to my greateſt Benefactor. To offend thee before I knew thee, was very ill; but to offend thee knowing thee, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thee ſtill to offend thee, is a much greater aggravation. To offend thee as an open Enemy is a great Crime; but to offend thee as a falſe Friend, and a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſciple, is the higheſt of Treaſons. To contrive and commit Sins in thine abſence without remembring that thou ſtandeſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, is very bad, ſince there is no abſence from thee who art in all places; but to offend thee in ſight of thy Divine Countenance, and even while born upon thy Shoulders, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray thee in thy very Houſe and at thy very<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98258:21"/>Table, is a degree of Wickedneſs above all compariſon. I am utterly loſt, O Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thy kindneſs pardon and direct me; My Sins deſerve a thouſand Hells, unleſs thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs and Mercy free and defend me.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How often good God after having been cleanſed have I return'd to wallow in the Mire! How often after having been cur'd, have I renew'd my wounds; and like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Soldier, forſaken the Banners of thy Grace and enter'd my ſelf in pay under thine Enemies Colours! How often like thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Diſciple, have I ſold thee for the vile price of ſome beaſtly Pleaſure! Many a time to ſatisfie my anger or revenge, have I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thy Meekneſs; Many a time have I by deſpiſing and trampling upon others, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thy great Humility; Many a time have I by known and wilful Sins, fearleſly ventur'd to provoke thy Juſtice. O dear Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, tye me now faſt to thy Croſs, let not my Lips, nor my Soul be parted from thy divine Feet; faſten me with thy Nails; pierce me with the Launce that wounded thee; and by that wound receive me into, and hide me in thy Heart; free me from my ſelf; free me from all my Vices, by thy holy Vertues; and by thy ſacred Wounds, O heavenly Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, heal thoſe many, whereby, though I have made my ſelf the moſt unworthy, and the moſt wretched of thy Creatures, yet am I thereby the fitter Object of thy Mercies.</p>

                  <head>The Firſt WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Remembrance of Death.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WOuld'ſt thou amend thy looſe, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Life? Remember Death; and do while thou liveſt, as thou would'ſt wiſh to have done, when thou ſhalt come to die. This Life which thou thinkeſt ſo laſting, is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This Life which thou liveſt as if thou thought'ſt it would never have an end, is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment, and is making an end of thee. Death comes flying ſpeedily to us, and we are running as faſt to it; they quickly meet that ſeek one another with ſo much haſte. Would'ſt thou take off thy value and eſteem from that which is corruptible? Look upon all things as ſubject to Death, and full of Corruption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All that is in this World breaths Death in the midſt of Life; and all that ſeems Life, is a ſecret Death. Kingdoms and Empires die; ſome deſtroy'd by the Hands of others; ſome even by their own. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was ſlain by the <hi>Medes;</hi> that of the <hi>Medes</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98258:22"/>by the <hi>Perſians;</hi> that of the <hi>Perſians</hi> by the <hi>Graecians;</hi> that of the
<hi>Graecians</hi> by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that of the <hi>Romans</hi> by many ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then they all made an end of one another. If the whole, which is ſtrong and potent, die; can any part live, which is weak and divided within it ſelf? The ſtatelieſt and ſtrongeſt Buildings die. Look, and thou ſhalt no where find the Coloſſe's, the Mauſoleum's, the Palaces, and higheſt Edifices of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Thoſe Towers, which ſeem'd to touch the Stars, ruined themſelves by their own weight, and greatneſs. If Houſes of the moſt laſting Marble die; ſhall this petty Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of them live, whoſe Body is but a little duſt, that vaniſheth at a blaſt of wind?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Might, and Power alſo dies conquer'd ſometimes by it ſelf; ſometimes by a greater Power. What is become of thoſe Gyants of Vanity, who with ſo much Pride did trample upon all the World? What is become of thoſe, who made whole Monarchies to tremble at their lighteſt Motions or Diſguſts? They are now a heap of Bones, lying upon the Earth; and they who ſtruck ſo great a Terror through all the Earth, are themſelves reduc'd to Earth already. Yeſterday they trampled all under their feet; to day they are trampled under feet by all, and thrown out to be the Food of Worms. There is no need of Thunder-boks from Heaven, to ſtrike down this Power ſo full of weakneſs; Earthquakes are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on this occaſion. There needs neither<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98258:23"/>Conflagration, nor Deluge; nor all, no not ſo much as one of the Elements; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if there be but one Humour diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd within a Man's own Body; a malignant Feaver will ſerve the turn; nay, a fatal Sneeze, upon a violent occaſion is ſufficient. This is the hard neceſſity, to which all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power is tied and ſubject; and to which it muſt be forc't to yield. Who then would fear any other Power, but that of God, which is the true Power indeed?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What is become of the Honour, the Riches, and the Authority of thoſe Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, whom once the World adored? It end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Power, Imperial and Royal Crowns and Scepters, Pontifical Miters, Palls and Croſiers, with all ſuch Enſigns of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty roul up and down on the Wheel of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, following the courſe of Days, Hours and Moments. Scarce do they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when they are already vaniſhed; ſcarce have they begirt the Brows of one, when they inſtantly forſake him, to ſeek the Brows of another; Yeſterday a Throne, to day a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin; Yeſterday Rich, and cloathed with ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Robes; to day reduc'd to Rags, and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. And are Wealth and Honours ſubject to theſe ſudden Changes? Who then would ſeek any other Honour, but that of God, and of an humble vertuous Life? Who would ſeek other Riches, than thoſe of his Gifts and Graces?</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98258:23"/>5. What, and doth Beauty, Gallantry, Sprightlineſs and good Humour die too? One may rather doubt whether they live at all: So great is the Vanity, and Shortneſs of them. Where are now thoſe
<hi>Narciſſus</hi>'s, and <hi>Adonis</hi>'s, thoſe <hi>Venus</hi>'s, and
<hi>Cleopatras</hi>'s; thoſe <hi>Livias</hi>'s, and other Flowers of Beauty which in each Age ſhew themſelves, and vaniſh almoſt at the ſame hour? Death cuts them all down, and that which is leſs, even Life it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys them. Riches, Power, and Temporal Greatneſs, do ſometimes laſt as long as Life; and nothing but Death alone does conquer them; but Beauty is ſo frail a thing, that 'tis ſubject to be cut off, not only by Death, but even by Life alſo; That which was yeſterday, the Envy and Admiration of the World, to day is Uglineſs and Deformity. A ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ſwelling of a Cheek, or a diſcolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Complexion, a ſmall Addition or Abatement in the Plumpneſs of the Face; an outward Alteration, or Change of the Countenance, whether natural or violent, takes away the former Air, and preſently farewel handſomneſs. Let but a little Rheum fall into the Eyes, a few Wrinkles ſhrivel the Skin; a ſmall Convulſion pull the Mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, a few Pimples break out in the Noſe; or any internal Humour diſcompoſe that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Symmetry; and inſtantly there is an end of Beauty. There is no need of Death, nor Small-pox, Wounds, nor Burnings: A little Wind, a little Nothing will ſerve to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98258:24"/>that delicate Flower. Did I ſay nothing? That was too much, for it decayeth and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth of it ſelf, and is it ſelf its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Beauty ('tis ſtrange) dies with living, ends with laſting, and is ruin'd by its Conſervation. Is it not a wonderful thing, that living, and continuing, ſhould make it become horrible and loathſome? That the handſomeſt Perſon ſhould only by living, become abominable and deformed? And that meerly the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, ſhould make the moſt beautiful Lady to be abhorred? According to this, it plainly appears, that that which we have thought to be Life, is Death; that which we have thought a Being, is not a Being, but a ceaſing to be; that which we take to be Truth, is Falſhood; that which ſeems to be Riches, and Authority, is Impotence and Vanity; and that which looks like Life, is Death, or at leaſt a Shadow of Death.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let us therefore lift up our Eyes, and Hearts to that Life which is Eternal, and knows no Death. Of what Importance, of what value can that be, which either leaves me while I live, or muſt be left by me when I die? Nothing is laſting, or of any worth, but Vertue, Truth and Piety. To ſerve God, and to pleaſe him, is the only Riches and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that the only Beauty which laſteth to Eternity.</p>

                  <head>The Second WEEK.</head>
                  <head>How much it concerns the Soul, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Death in the Time of Life.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider, that Life paſſeth away, that Death haſtens; and that thou thy ſelf art the Theatre of thine own Tragedy. I will not tell thee that Death is coming, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come; with it thou liveſt, with it thou eateſt, with it thou walkeſt, and laboureſt; and with it thou ſleepeſt; Now ſince thou ſleepeſt with it; Why doeſt not thou awake with it alſo? An indiſpoſition of thy Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; the aking of thy Head; a pain in any part of thy Body; briefly, all ſuch like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, are ſo many knocks that Death gives at thy Door, to rouze thee to the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it: Lend but thine Ear to hearken, and thou ſhalt hear it call upon thee; in the beginning of thy ſickneſs, it begins to finiſh what it has been about ever ſince thou were born; and Death makes an end of thee, even in the time of thy very Life. It is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy, that allows no means to fly, to make reſiſtance, or to capitulate! A terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, that will neither pardon, nor be perſwaded, nor ſuffer it ſelf to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98258:25"/>nor conquered, nor convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ah, yield thy ſelf to Death, before it force thee to yield, and to wait upon its tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Receive it by Meditation, before it come to execution; accuſtom thy ſelf to the Thought of Death, and that will take away the Fear of Death. It is a great Morſel, and will not be got down the Throat at once; thou had'ſt need to divide it into parts, by frequent conſideration, that thou mayeſt be able to ſwallow it the more eaſily. The Saints by often thinking of it, made their Death more tolerable, and their Life more religious. Their end was always preſent to them, and by that means they made both the beginning, and the middle of all their Actions holy. To forget Death is a great Miſchief, and an evident Deſtruction. The unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided Soldier, is already foil'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why are ſo many ruined in their Life? Becauſe they bear not in mind the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Death? Why are ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned after Death? Becauſe it was never preſent to their thoughts, in the time of their Life. They live, as if they never were to die; they die, as if they were never to be judged; and yet in one inſtant, they are dead, judged, and condemn'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do all the Actions of thy Life, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtill an eye to thy Death; this will leſſen the Fear of thy Account, and of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98258:25"/>which condemns to eternal death. Woe be to thee, if thou ſtayeſt till death, to begin to live! Woe be to thee, if thou ſtayeſt till thy end, to begin to work! Woe be to thee, if thou deceiveſt thy ſelf with to Morrow, to Morrow, to Morrow; and art ſo fooliſh, as to think thy ſelf ſure of to Morrow. No, let thy delays be applied to ſin; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time to repentance; to day, to day, to day; nay inſtantly, this very moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail thy offences, and reſolve upon amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſay to morrow, to morrow, (or rather never, never) when thou art tempted to commit a wilful Sin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Oh how many are now burning in Hell, for being ſuch fools, as to believe that they ſhould find a to Morrow to repent in; and who neither found Repentance, nor to Morrow! Oh how many are now burning in Hell, becauſe they would not repent when they might, and afterwards could not when they would! Oh how many are there now burning in Hell, who delay'd to work out their Salvation, while the Light of their Day laſted; and afterwards had neither light, nor time, being ſeized upon ſuddenly by the dark Night of Death! Fools, ridiculous Fools, that left the Matter of greateſt Importance, to be done in the time of greateſt Confuſion! Fools, ridiculous Fools, to give the worſt of their time, to the ſaving of their Souls, which is the only Matter of<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98258:26"/>Concernment; and the preſent, which is the beſt and the moſt acceptable, to the damning of them! To imploy their Health, their Youth, and their Strength, in ſinful Pleaſures; and to put off their Contrition, and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they are ſick, and old, and feeble! In offending the Juſt, the Holy and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God, they ſpend all the Years of their Life; and to obtain Pardon, can afford no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Moment of their death! To offend him, they give all their Senſes, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Faculties, while they are quick and lively; and think them good enough for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when they are dull, ſleepy and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified! They lay the heavy load of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon decrepid old Age, which is not able to bear it ſelf; and waſte their moſt active and vigorous Days, in vain delights and trifles! Finally, they lie dead in Sins, all the Years of their Life; and preſume they ſhall be able to riſe to Repentance (that is to lead a godly Life) in the Hour of their Death!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Suppoſe a tender hearted Father, pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ruine of a Son juſtly diſinherited and brought to ſlavery by his many Rebellions, ſhould ſend Meſſengers on purpoſe to fetch him home from Captivity to his Favour, and to his Fortune; provided he return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certain Day prefixt; Suppoſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, the Road is very dangerous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially near his Journey's end, and that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening will probably be very dark and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous.<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98258:26"/>What wouldſt thou think of him, if inſtead of haſtening to his Father's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and the plenty of his Houſe, he ſhould be ſo ungrateful to his Father's kindneſs, ſo forgetful of his paſt miſery, and ſo regardleſs of his future happineſs as to turn into the firſt pleaſant Meadow he ſpies by the way, and if notwithſtanding the many earneſt Calls of thoſe that were ſent to bring him, (who tell him how the day waſts, and that they cannot ſtay for him) he ſhould lie down and loiter out the time, picking up Flowers, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Butterflies, till Night force him in the midſt of ſtormy Winds, Rains, and Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, to grope for his way alone in the Dark, through Bryars, Bogs and Precipices, where it is in a manner impoſſible to eſcape De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
                  <p>It is hard to think that any Man can poſſibly be ſo ſtupid, and wretched or ſo wilfully fooliſh; yet thou thy ſelf, art much more ſtupid, wretched, and fooliſh than He; if deluded by the Pleaſure of Sin, thou delayeſt thy Repentance till the Night of Death; for He knew the certain number of Hours in his Day, but thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not how few there may be in thine, nor how ſuddenly thy Sun may ſet, and leave thee (perhaps before thy Noon) expoſed to a darker and a more tempeſtuous Paſſage. Again, He lies in the cool Shade of a pleaſant Meadow, but thou probably lieſt wallowing like a Swine in the Mire of Senſuality, or basking in the Heat of Luſt, in ſpite of the Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98258:27"/>of thy Spiritual Guides, that would bring thee into the Ways that are truly pleaſant, and into the Paths of Peace. In ſhort, He by the delay of his Journey, ventures but the loſs of an earthly Inheritance, or at the worſt of a temporal Life; but thou by that of thy repentance wilt looſe an inheritance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in the Heavens, which fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and not only a temporal Life (as well as he) but alſo an eternal one, receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, an everlaſting Death, as the juſt Reward of thy more wilful Folly.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Again, Suppoſe a Husbandman, inſtead of manuring, plowing, and ſowing his Land in the right Seaſon, ſhould waſte the Year in careleſneſs, and think it time enough to fall to thoſe buſineſſes, when his Neighbours who have done them all in due order, are reaping their Corn and filling their Barns with a plentiful increaſe. What wouldſt thou judge of him, for having not only ſlighted their good Example, but deſpiſed their frequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to be more provident and induſtrious?</p>
                  <p>Though thou mayſt have learnt by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Simile, to apply this to thy ſelf; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but condemn thee as more ignorant than the very Birds and Beaſts, for they infallibly know and exactly obſerve their ſeveral Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But all they that delay their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are beyond compariſon more ignorant and more ſlothful then that Husbandman; conſidering the infinite diſproportion there is,<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98258:27"/>between thoſe hopes that ſhould have moved his Induſtry, and thoſe aſſurances which ſhould encourage theirs; as likewiſe between thoſe fears, that ſhould have quicken'd his ſloth; and thoſe terrors, that ſhould rouze up theirs. That Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman might poſſibly make a ſhift, though a hard one, to rub out that fruitleſs Year by the help of charitable Perſons, and having dearly bought more wit, by the ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Poverty, might buckle cloſe to his work, and by future diligence againſt the following Harveſt, be Maſter of as rich a Crop as any in the Field; but if thou defer thy Repentance till the Harveſt of Death, there is no poſſibility for thee to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Year. No in that Harveſt thou ſhalt be reaped thy ſelf, and bound up with the Tares to be caſt into the Fire. Nor do thou adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to truſt to the Charity of others. But remember, that although the wiſe Virgins, had Oil in their Lamps, yet were they ſo far from having any to ſpare; that they had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough for themſelves; and when the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ones, that wanted, came to them for a ſupply, they were ſent away with a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and it being then too late, to get any for their Money, they were ſhut out from the Feaſt of the Bridegroom for ever.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Oh what ſad ſtories might be related to thee upon the Subject of delayed Repentance! How many Examples be there of Perſons that after long ſleeping ſecurely in Sin, have been<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98258:28"/>rouzed of a ſudden by the ſharp Stings of Conſcience at the Approach of Death, and frighted from the vain Confidence they had of their Salvation, into the other Extream of Deſpair, by the dreadful Terrors of Hell-fire, which then ſeemed to flaſh in their very faces! Some of them have ſtarted into ſuch diſmal Apprehenſions of God's ſevere Juſtice, which they never regarded before; that they quite forgot the abundance of his Mercy, whereof till then they had groundleſly made themſelves too ſure; nor could they in that condition, be perſwaded there was any pardon to be got for them, though they ſhould repent never ſo much; they could not believe the Goodneſs of God, though infinite, was large enough to afford them any ſhare in that Redemption, which he ſent his Son into the World expreſly to purchaſe for all Mankind, at the price of his moſt precious Blood. Though He be ſo gracious as to call all Sinners, and to ſay he came to ſeek and to ſave them that were loſt, profeſſing with an Oath, that he delights not in their death, <hi>but rather that they ſhould turn from their wickedneſs and live;</hi> Nay, that he would have all to be ſaved, and none to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; yet the Devil, taking advantage upon their having ſo long delayed to repent makes them now to believe that it is too late, as he did before that it was too ſoon. They can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no thoughts of God, but what are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, looking upon him as their greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſome of them, even hating him out
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98258:28"/>of a prodigious Belief that he created them on purpoſe for Damnation. This Crime is ſo heinous, and of ſo deep a dye, that the Stains of it can hardly be fetched out even with that Blood, which makes Sins though red as Scarlet, to become as white as Snow; yet not for want of Vertue in the Remedy, but becauſe that Sin, is ſo hardly repented of; nor is it ſtrange, if upon ſo high a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God in his Juſtice, ſuffer their wretched Bark, to be toſſed and weather-beaten, upon the unquiet Billows of a wounded Spirit; and to be daſhed in pieces againſt the Rock of Deſpair, by the violent Guſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Methinks I hear their loud Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and lamentable Cries, and though I dare not ſo much as imagine the horrible Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which ſome of them utter in that woful anguiſh of their Souls, yet I cannot but learn how amazing their condition is, and how inſupportable; ſince it makes divers of them hang, drown, poyſon, or ſtab themſelves, and blindly to fly from temporal into eternal Torments. Oh take warning by ſuch diſmal Examples, which the divine Providence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permits (as humane Juſtice does noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malefactors to be expoſed in Chains) for the greater Terror of all, that behold, or but hear the Narrative of their Execution.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And yet there is another State, which though quite contrary, is no leſs dangerous then theirs; and numberleſs is the Multitude of thoſe that are in it, which makes me the<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98258:29"/>more earneſtly beg of thee, to be careful thou be not one of them. Theſe flatter themſelves vainly with the falſe Notion of God's infinite Mercy, and quite forget the ſtrict ſeverity of his Juſtice: they think it enough to avoid groſs, and ſcandalous Sins, and count thoſe they commit ſo inconſiderable, that they are ſafe though they neither repent of them, nor regard the Performance of Religious Duties. Thus do they paſs their days in a Lethargy of Security, till their dead ſleep be changed into the Sleep of Death; and they ſwallowed up in the Gulph of Preſumption, without any noiſe; few reflecting upon their end, and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being warned by their Example. Some of them indeed ſeem to be more awaken'd; to riſe out of this Spiritual Lethargy; and to walk in the Courſe of Religious Duties; but reſting in the outward Performance of them, without the Sincerity of Repentance, or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of Devotion, they are but like Men that walk in their ſleep; and while they dream they are going in the right way to Heaven, drop into Hell with more preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in themſelves, and leſs warning to others, than the former; moſt thinking them in a ſafe Condition, and being therefore encourag'd to follow them in the ſame Road. But oh! take heed of that Security, and of reſting upon the broken Reed of formal Religion, for even ſome of thoſe Deſpairers that ſtrike ſo much terror into thoſe that ſee them may ſooner eſcape, provided their Deſpondency
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98258:29"/>proceed from in exceſſive apprehenſion of their own unworthineſs; which has been the Caſe of ſome very devout Souls, whoſe Faith hath failed, more out of the Timerouſneſs of their own Nature, than through any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of God's Mercy, or of their Saviour's Merits.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Would'ſt thou than eſcape from both theſe dangers? Conſider ſeriouſly the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, and the Certainty of Death; that the time of it when come can by no means be prolonged; that the Place, Manner and Time is utterly unknown to thee; that it will come like a Thief in the Night; that we can die but once; and if we do it ill, there is no ſecond time to do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that as the Tree falleth ſo it lieth. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine which way it would fall with thee, if it ſhould now be cut down; Let theſe thoughts fill thee with the holy Fear of God's Juſtice, which will keep thee from the Gulph of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Bring forth Fruits of Repentance, and entertain an humble Hope of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby thou ſhalt avoid the Rock of Deſpair; and looking up to Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of thy Faith, with the Arms of that Faith lay faſt hold upon the Merit of his Croſs, and ſo ſhalt thou paſs ſafely into the Haven of everlaſting Happineſs. Let not Life deceive thee, but let Death undeceive thee.

In that terrible moment, the Sinner will want Time, he will want Diſpoſition, he will want Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all things fitting for that weighty Buſineſs; and will abound in nothing but Pain, Terrour, Anguiſh and Confuſion.</p>

                  <head>The dreadful Call of God, to the Sinner that defers Repentance till his Death.</head>
                  <p>MEN want time to repent, becauſe God juſtly takes it from thoſe, that have ſo long abuſed his Mercy, and gone on delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Repentance, to ſuch a time as is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called a Moment than a Time. Thou haſt provoked my Anger, (ſays God to the Sinner) thou haſt forſaken and caſt me off during thy whole Life. How can'ſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98258:30"/>to find me kind and loving to thee at thy Death? I gave thee the beſt time, and thou giveſt me the worſt. Doeſt thou think it is ſo eaſie, to regain that beſt time which thou didſt deſpiſe, with the worſt, and in the worſt, till which thou haſt delayed to uſe it? When I gave thee Light and Strength, thou imployedſt it to perſecute me; and will it be eaſie for thee, without Strength and without Light, to ſeek me, and to find me? Is it all one thing, O preſumptuous Sinner, whether thou offendeſt, or pleaſeſt me? I have called upon thee, and wooed thee with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Invitations, and with innumerable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, ever ſince thou cameſt into the World: Is it enough for thee, having deſpiſed them all, and wounded me with thy Ingratitude, to come to me when thou art juſt going out of it? And canſt thou expect, that I will then receive thee? If thou art rejected then, O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, the Fault will not be mine, but thine own. If the buſineſs of thy whole Life, has been nothing but a wilful provocation of my Anger; Can there be any thing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, than at thy Death to expect my Favour? Is the Grace of Contrition in thy own Power, whenſoever it pleaſes thee? Wilt thou be able to do that in the inſtant of Death, which thou could'ſt not do in ſo many Years of thy Life? Wilt thou be able to do that with a diſturbed Judgment, and a confuſed Underſtanding, which thou never didſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor wouldſt ever learn while thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98258:31"/>and Judgment were clear and found? If the whole Cuſtom of thy long Life has been nothing elſe but ſinning, canſt thou, O Man be ſo ſenſleſs, as to look that the end of ſuch a wretched Life, ſhould be merit and reward? How canſt thou hope to die a Saint, having ever lived a ſcandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? If ſo many repeated acts of Sin, have begot in thee a powerful Habit and an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cuſtom of deſpiſing me; Which way wilt thou begin to overcome that Cuſtom, when thy Life is at an end? If thou haſt ſpoken but one Language all thy Life; wouldſt thou go about the learning of another quite contrary to it, in the Moment of thy Death?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So long as thou didſt live in health, thou never wert acquainted with ſorrow for ſin, nor kneweſt what it was to be contrite and penitent; will it be eaſie for thee to learn and practice theſe things, when thou art going out of the World, to which thou wert ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe all the time of thy being in it? If thou haſt ſpent it all in the deceits and entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenſual Delights, How wilt thou be able to get looſe from them, and free thy ſelf in that ſhort inſtant, when thy Soul is to be ſeparated from thy Body? If then thou wouldſt leave them, they will not leave thee; thou holdeſt them faſt, and they ſtick as faſt to thee: How will you then get looſe from one another? Canſt thou be willing to leave that at thy death, which thou never wouldeſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98258:31"/>forſake, nay, which thou didſt ever run after, and hug with ſo much fondeſs all thy life? I ſhall be willing to pardon thee, O Man, but thou wilt not be able to ask me pardon; the fault will not be in me, O Sinner, but in thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou wouldſt never think of Death, much leſs think how to dye; and then thou wilt not know which way to beg for Pardon, becauſe thou wouldſt never endeavour to learn; and that time muſt then be ſpent in dying, which ought to be ſpent in bagging forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thou wilt not be able, becauſe thy Will, diſturbed with fears, will fail thee; thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will be darken'd with Anguiſh, thy Memory afflicted with Sins, thy Senſes dulled and decayed with a mortal Sickneſs; and finally, all thy abilities will be meer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities. Thou haſt waſted all thy life, as if there were never to be a death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt not have power to repent thee, at thy death, which is the death of Eternal Life. Thou never in all thy life didſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there is a Hell; and therefore at thy death thou wilt either forget it, or elſe be ſo preſt with the fear of going thither, that thou wilt not be able to pour down Tears, nor ſend up Prayers to eſcape it. Thou haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Judgment, as if there were to be no Judgment; without calling thy ſelf to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as if thou wert never to be called to Account; therefore, O ſinner, thou wilt find
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98258:32"/>at thy death, that 'tis more eaſie to tremble at thy Account than to give it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou haſt ſpent all thy life in ſin and wickedneſs, without any remembrance of the Glory to come; what Idea therefore can thy Memory have of that Glory, when thou comeſt to dye? If it be tedious and weariſome to thee to confeſs a few daily ſins, how doſt thou think thou ſhalt find Diligence and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough when thou comeſt to dye, to confeſs that infinite number thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the time of thy birth? Thou canſt not (or wilt not) now in thy health lift a hundred weight, and doſt thou think thou ſhalt be able in thy ſickneſs to lift a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand? Doſt thou reſerve that weight to be laid upon thee in thy weakneſs, which thou dareſt not venture to lift at in thy full ſtrength? What profit or advantage can thy Death bring thee, when all thy care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will be imployed about the loſing of thy Life? Thy Heart being glued to the Wealth and to the World, which thou muſt leave; How wilt thou be able to looſen it from thence, and to join it to what thou haſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cared for? The Chains of thy Paſſions, tye thee faſt to this tranſitory World; How wilt thou be able to break them in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and to give thy ſelf to that which is eternal?</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98258:32"/>5. It coſt me Tears, and Groans; Prayers, and loud Cries to raiſe up <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who had been dead but four days, of a natural Death; What will it coſt to raiſe up thee, from the ſpiritual Death, in which thou haſt lain dead (perhaps) theſe forty Years? I raiſed up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> without his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to help towards his own Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but I will not revive thee, unleſs thou doſt ſomething on thy part, and how wilt thou be able, O wretched Man, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that under a double Death; thy Soul in that of Sin, and thy Body ſo near to that of Corruption? Thy Spirit being conquered, and having yielded it ſelf a Slave to thine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which has domineer'd powerfully all thy Life, and forc't thy Soul to the Drudgery of Sin: Doſt thou believe, that in breathing out thy laſt Gaſp, thou ſhalt be able to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its liberty? No, thou wilt find, that though it be freed from thy Body, for a time, it is going to ſuffer a much greater ſlavery in Hell, and to be tormented by the Devil in Chains of Darkneſs, till the Day of Judgment; when thy Body indeed ſhall riſe from the Grave, as did that of
<hi>Lazarus</hi> to be joined again with thy Soul; yet not, as his, to Life, but to die eternally, and to be for ever baniſhed from my ſight.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thou haſt uſed thy ſelf, all thy Life, to follow thine own will, and never to deny thy ſelf in any thing; and doeſt thou think, thou ſhalt have power, to do that in the end of it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98258:33"/>which has always been ſo contrary to thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations? Or if thou haſt endeavour'd to get Victories over thy ſelf, and haſt fought without ſucceſs, that ſpiritual Combate; is it probable thou ſhalt overcome thy ſelf, better in thy utmoſt weakneſs, and when thou lieſt gaſping for Breath? If thou couldſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that Enemy, when thou hadſt all thy ſtrength, if with the force of Reaſon, quicken'd by frequent Admonitions, called upon by many Exhortations, and excited by ſeveral good Examples, thou could'ſt not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thy ſenſual Appetite, in ſo many Years; how wilt thou conquer it, when thy Reaſon, and Underſtanding ſhall have forſaken thee, and when the Ear of thy Body, ſhall be as deaf to all other Motives as that of thy Soul has been till then? Thinkeſt thou, when thou lieſt fainting in thy Death-bed, without ſtrength to move a Hand, rattling in the Throat, and gaſping for Breath; to overcome that Enemy, that potent Enemy inſulting over thee, in the Pride of ſo many repeated Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? That Enemy, which the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Succeſſors, with ſo many other excellent Saints, fought againſt all their Lives; wilt thou conquer, with the dregs of thine; being without Memory, without Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and even without Senſe, in that great diſorder, and confuſion which Death uſes to bring eſpecially to thoſe, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuffer'd their Appetite to triumph over them?</p>

I do not bid thee deſpair when thou dieſt; but I bid thee work out thy Salvation with fear and trembling while thou liveſt; I deny not, but that I ſaved the good Thief; He believed on me, when my Diſciples forſook me, and fled; and prayed to me, even when I was nailed to the Croſs; to ſuch an extraordinary Faith, I ſhew'd an extraordinary Favour; and though I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he ſhould be with me that day in Paradice; thou mayeſt remember, I ſuffered him that was crucified with me on the other hand, to be condemned. If he, who died ſo near my ſide, and looking upon that Blood, which I ſhed for him, was damned; Wilt thou delay ſtill, and hope to eſcape, at that laſt Hour? I do not forbid thee to hope, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to die; but I bid thee to do good works in the mean while; and ſerve me during thy Life, without deferring it till Death; for if thou deſpiſeſt the warning I give thee now, the time will come, when thou ſhalt call, and I will not hear; and when thou ſhalt cry, Lord, Lord, I will anſwer, I know thee not thou worker of Iniquity. <hi>Depart from me, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>

                  <head>The Fourth WEEK.</head>
                  <head>The Anſwer of a repenting Sinner, and that we ought to prepare our ſelves for Death.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AH, let us all quake, and tremble; what ſhall we anſwer to theſe terrible Words of the Lord? What ſhall we anſwer to theſe Arguments, which are rather evident Concluſions? What ſhall we anſwer to that eternal Wiſdom, to that eternal Light, and Truth, whoſe Sayings are undeniable, and whoſe Accuſings are clear Convictions? Here is nothing to be done, but to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our guilt, to humble our ſelves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Lives. Here is nothing to be done, but with Repentance, Humility and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to weep and ſigh and earneſtly beg for Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is nothing to be done, but with a moſt intimate Deſire and Sorrow of the Soul, to ſay; Lord I have ſinned againſt thee all my Life, and I will bewail my offences du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Life, that I may likewiſe bewail them at my Death. If I be not willing to lament them now, perhaps then, I ſhall neither be willing nor able. I ſinned in the beſt of my time, and ſo made it the worſt; and I deſire
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98258:34"/>to forſake my Sins, in the beſt that remains; before the laſt comes, which is the worſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. I deſire, O God, to imploy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days in thy Service; ſince thou yet affordeſt me time to bewail that time, which I ſo ſinfully have loſt. I deſire to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my Sins, with all my Senſes Powers, and Faculties; ſince I have abuſed them all in offending againſt thee my God; nor will I defer my Tears, till my Death, ſince I did not defer my Sins till my Death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I deſire, O Lord, that I may not be to ſeek for Oil in my Lamp, when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom calls, but to have it ready prepar'd and lighted, againſt his coming. To get Oil after death, is impoſſible; grant that I may buy it, and furniſh my ſelf before I fall aſleep. Life, without thy Grace, is not only Sleep but Death; grant therefore, O Lord, that I may prepare for Death, during Life, by living well. Grant, O Lord my God, that the Bridegroom at his coming may find me watching; grant, O Lord, that when the Thief ſhall come to break into this Houſe of my Body, and rob me of my Soul, I may not be found aſleep, in any cuſtomary Sin, but awake upon my Guard, and with my Lamp ready lighted; and let me never hear from thee the Light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, that terrible ſaying, <hi>I know thee not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Grant that at thy ſecond coming, thou mayeſt find me with my Loins girt, and my Light burning, and able to give ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Talents which thou haſt given<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98258:35"/>me, that the Benefits of thy former coming, may by thy Mercy be made effectual to my Soul. What ſhall become of me, O my God if I looſe thee? If once I looſe thee, O Light eternal, when ſhall I be able ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thee? Deliver my Soul from the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion; free my darling from the Power of the infernal Dragon; if once I looſe my ſelf and thee; Is it poſſible I ſhould ever find thee again, my Saviour? Is there any paſſage from Hell, to Glory? Is there any Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that place of Torment, where all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are utterly cut off? Shall I expoſe my Soul to that hazard, to that danger, and to that loſs at my Death, for not repenting while I live? Shall I truſt that which is moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and moſt important, to the moſt unfit and the moſt uncertain time? Shall I put off, the looſing or enjoying thee eternally, O my Jeſus, to a Conjuncture ſo full of anguiſh and confuſion, as ſcarce affords a poſſibility of knowing thee? No, Lord, ſuffer me not I beſeech thee to fall into ſo miſerable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; rather let me die now, inſtantly, at this preſent moment, in thy Grace; than ſo fooliſhly to adventure the loſs of both thy Grace and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is the Anſwer we ſhould make to God; theſe are the Thoughts we ought to feel; theſe are the Requeſts we ought to make, before the Agony of Death, for then the Pains of the Body, the Anguiſh of the Soul, the Grief for leaving the Pleaſures of <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98258:35"/>this World, and the Fear of going into the Torments of the next; the Diſtraction of thy Thoughts, and the Decay of thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will neither ſuffer thee to attend thy Prayers, nor allow thee time to conſider what to pray for; O how ignorant, how mad a Folly it is, to delay our amendment till the Hour of Death! What a miſtake it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our dammage does not increaſe with that deceit, and our deceit with that dammage! What an Error, to think I ſhall be better; when I ſee, and feel my ſelf daily growing worſe! And that the end of my Life ſhall be good, when the whole courſe of it from the beginning, has been evil! What a Cheat the Devil puts upon a Man, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that when his Soul is torn out of his Body, he ſhall be able to imploy himſelf in any thing elſe, than to feel that ſtrong Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion between the Body and the Soul!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This puts an end to the Sinner's Life; this puts an end to his Delights, this puts an end to his Acquaintance. His Friends, his Riches, his Honour, his Power; all theſe muſt be left; this is the thing that diſquiets and afflicts him; thither his Mind runs then where he had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his contentment; thither his ſorrow, his torture and confuſion where he had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetted his Heart. His thought, his care and his attention being taken up with what he loſes, and which is worſe, with what he fears; he is in too great a Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98258:36"/>to diſcourſe of that which he ſhould, and which imports him moſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And therefore, if thou wilt live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; die before thou dieſt. Think of that now, which thou meaneſt to think of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Let not Death go out of thy Memory, and ſo thou ſhalt amend thy Life. Live, and do all things, as a Perſon that muſt die, and thou ſhalt die to live for ever. Thy Death ſhall be but a Paſſage, not a Death; and a paſſage to eternal Life; not a dying to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. NOW give ear, and I will tell another thing, more dreadful and terrible; more quick and ſpeedy; and of more hazard and danger, Anger, than Death it ſelf. And that is the account thou art inſtantly to give; with the Judgment and Sentence that ſhall be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon thee in particular, at the Moment of thy Death. What, ſo ſoon? Yes, ſo ſoon; ſcarce dead, when already judged; and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt, either to abſolve, or to condemn thee! The Body is not yet quite cold upon its Bed; And is the Soul judged already? They are yet holding a Looking-glaſs to my Mouth, to try whether I have any Breath left in me; and is my Cauſe already diſpatched, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſentenced? The Body is not yet put into a Winding-ſheet; and is the Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready judged, and which is more the Sentence executed upon it! Shall there not be a little delay? Will they not allow me a little ſpace,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98258:37"/>to think how I may ſatisfie by ſome excuſe, the Charge that is brought againſt me? Will they pluck me away, and precipitate me ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without having any thing to lay hold on, when I am driven out of the Body; without any thing to lay hold on, when I am ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Judgment; without any thing to lay hold on, when I am hurried to execution; without finding one moment of delay, ere I receive the Sentence? Is it poſſible, that there is no place of refuge? No retreat, where I may ſtop a little, though it were but at the foot of that very Judgment-ſeat, where I am to be ſentenced, or at the Threſhold of that Dungeon, where I am to he impriſoned? May not the Execution be ſuſpended for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while? Is there no Chappel, as I paſs where a condemned Perſon may linger a while, and pray between the Judgment-ſeat and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal place of Torment? Is it poſſible that there is no other way, either on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand or on the Left, from Death to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to this Judgment and to this Sentence, whereby I may eſcape and hide my ſelf? Can I not turn back again? Is it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I muſt be thrown headlong? Muſt I needs ſwallow that bitter draught, and be forc't to make that irrevocable leap from the Delights of this World to the Miſeries of the other?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98258:37"/>3. No, no, there is no remedy; that moſt bitter Potion, is forc't, not voluntary; and it muſt of neceſſity be drunk, for they will not let thee ſpill it. To die, to be judged, to have Sentence executed; and to conclude all, and make an end for ever, is but one inſtant. See how thou goeſt out of this Life, for ſo thou ſhalt enter into Judgment; ſee in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thou art to make thy account, for in the ſame thou ſhalt come from thy account; ſee well, how thy Caſe ſtands, for according to the Proof, ſo ſhall the Sentence be. There is no mending of Anſwers, no Wreſtings, nor Perjuries, nor Briberies in that high Court of Juſtice; all is diſpatched in a moment; the Charge, the Anſwer, the Judgment, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and the Execution. The Sentence is but to look upon the Criminal; to come into the Preſence of God is to be condemned, and even but to come into the Preſence of God, is a caſting off the Wicked from his ſight for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a receiving of the Good into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Joys.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What, and is there then no remedy for a Sinner before God's Tribunal? Is there no way to come off from that Judgment, and from that account? Yes, there is a remedy; But what, I beſeech you? To judge thy ſelf in this Life, and to call thy ſelf daily to ſtrict account. Let the Sinner paſs Judgment upon himſelf, during his Life, and then his Death ſhall be a Comfort; his Account a Bleſſing; that great Day, a Day of Mercy; then the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98258:38"/>Sentence ſhall be Joy; and the Execution Glory. The Sentence is publiſhed there; but the Tryal is made here; and according as the Caſe is found, the Sentence is fitted to the Tryal. God pronounces the Sentence, in his Tribunal, according to the Tryal; but thou and I are here forming and giving Matter to that Tryal, by our Thoughts, by our Words, and by our Actions. Take heed what thou doeſt, for there thou ſhalt find it; and take heed what thou ſayeſt, for there thou ſhalt hear it; the Tryal, I ſay, is of our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; by it that moſt righteous Judge ſhall judge us; take heed then what thou thinkeſt, for there thou ſhalt ſee it; and take heed what thou ſoweſt, for there thou ſhalt reap it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As thy Life ſhall be here, ſuch ſhall be thy Death, thy Account, and thy Sentence at that Tribunal, and afterwards the Execution. The Judgment is God's Truth; the Sentence is his Righteouſneſs, and the Execution his Juſtice. It is neither the Judgment, nor the Sentence principally, which condemns a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the wickedneſs of his Life. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God's eternal Judgment, is rather a Declaration, then a Condemnation. Thou didſt ſentence and condemn thy ſelf, when thou didſt Sin; and being already condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou goeſt to be judged by dying in thy ſins. All that is done there, is but to declare, that thy Wickedneſs, deſerves Hell; and thy Life, eternal Death.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98258:38"/>6. And according to this, at the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Goſpel, our Lord ſays nothing elſe in pronouncing it; <hi>but Go ye curſed, or Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> He does not ſay, My will condemns the Wicked, nor my will abſolves the Good; as he finds them, ſo he judges; he finds thoſe curſed; and as curſed he caſts them from him; he finds theſe bleſſed, and as bleſſed he calls them, he embraces them, and takes them to himſelf. The reaſon of this is becauſe that as God is the eternal Truth, he judges according as he finds the Tryal, and if that be deadly, the Sentence of neceſſity muſt be ſo likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He that will eſcape Judgment, at the Day of Judgment, muſt begin from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time to judge himſelf. He that will clear his account at that day of Account, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in this Life to call himſelf to an account. Let a Man take good heed on what hand he lives in this mortal Life, on that hand he ſhall be placed in the immortal Life: if on the Left hand, then on the Left; if on the Right-hand, on the Right: In this World which is full of Deceits and Equivocations in Suits and Cauſes; all the danger of the Perſon condemned, is in the Judgment paſt upon him; for his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence will little avail to ſave him, if the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence condemn him; nor if that abſolve him, will the greateſt Crime and the moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved do him any harm: but at God's Tribunal, the Danger is not in the Sentence, but in the Caſe of the Criminal. Hereby,<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98258:39"/>amongſt many other Reaſons, God is juſtified in condemning the Wicked, although he be Mercy it ſelf; for it is not his Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Pity; but the Sins, the Guilt and the Malice of the Wicked that condemns them. 'Tis they that chooſe their own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for they make their own proceſs in this Life. 'Tis they that make Hell their own choice, becauſe they wilfully chooſe thoſe Sins that carry them thither; and will not chooſe Repentance, that would free them from it. They are the makers of their own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and themſelves are the Cauſes of their Death, their Hell and their Damnation; by not applying Tears and Contrition to their Sins.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. O, what a ſtrange Doctrine is this! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, there is nothing to be fear'd at the Day of Judgment, but our Lives; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be fear'd in the Sentence, but our Sins.</p>
                  <p>Nay all is to be fear'd; for terrible and dreadful are the Judgments of the Lord; yet are they juſt, righteous, and holy; therefore, fear Sin, which brings thee to be ſentenc'd; fear Guilt, which brings thee for ever to be condemned; fear that Sentence, which throws thee into eternal Damnation; and fear that Judgment, which caſts thee headlong to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments.</p>

                  <head>Of the Rectitude and Severity of the Judgment.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT admit all this be ſo, yet may not ſome of our faults be forgotten, or ſome of our Sins excuſed at that Day? Thô I go out of this Life in the Judge's disfavour, may I not in the other Appeal, or reply, or beg, and obtain his Favour before he paſs the Sentence? May I not by Gift, or Craft, or Induſtry, or ſubtilty of Diſcourſe, evade, or extenuate, or hide, or at leaſt diſguiſe the Sins I have committed?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. O how fooliſhly doeſt thou argue, if thou canſt have ſuch a Thought! Thou art more blind in thy reaſoning, than thou art in ſinning: for that is but weakneſs; but this the higheſt Ignorance. What excuſe canſt thou poſſibly have, for offending thy God, and thy Redeemer, who died upon the Croſs only to free thee from Death, and Sin. What excuſe for not being willing to take the Benefit of his Sacraments? What excuſe for rejecting his Helps, and holy Inſpirations? What excuſe for the frequent rebelling againſt his holy Commandments? What excuſe for refuſing<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98258:40"/>his divine Counſels? What excuſe for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thine ears to the Maſters of Chriſtian Inſtruction; and to thoſe loud Cries with which his Preachers daily call upon thee from their Pulpits?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What canſt thou ſay, for having neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Directions of thy Spiritual Guides, thoſe internal Phyſicians of Souls, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? What canſt thou ſay, for having ſo often turned away from God, who by them called upon thee, daily intreating thee, and offering thee eternal Life? What for following his and thine own Enemy that offer'd thee nothing but eternal Death? What canſt thou ſay to quit thy ſelf from ſo many Accuſations? What Evaſion canſt thou find to ſo full an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Or how wilt thou get off from ſo weighty a Charge, wherein thou wilt not be able to anſwer ſo much as one of Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand? If the Charge be true, how will it be poſſible for thee to oppoſe the Truth; thy Judge being alſo the Truth it ſelf? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit will be able to prevail before ſo great a Light, and ſuch a manifeſt Conviction? Doſt thou think, O ſimple Creature, to over-reach that infinite Wiſdom? Doth thy Ignorance think to circumvent him, who ſees the time preſent, the time paſt, and the time to come, all at one inſtant? Or does thy fooliſh proud Preſumption, hope to eſcape his all-ſeeing Eye? Thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, and not him, in ſo ſilly a conceit; his Judgments are Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; his Sentences Truths, and his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98258:40"/>Juſtice; and doeſt thou think there can be forgetfulneſs of thy faults in that eternal Comprehenſion that beholds all things? There is not the lighteſt Thought, the ſuddeneſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inconſiderableſt Word, nor the ſmalleſt Action, which is not punctually regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred there. That eternal Juſtice has all Sins counted, weighed, and meaſured in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from the firſt bitter Fruit of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apple, to the laſt and ſlighteſt Sin of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, till the end of the World. That which was only known to thy Chamber, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creteſt; Corner of thy Houſe, or of thy Heart; that which is unknown to thy moſt favoured Servant, or moſt intimate Friend, is all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and manifeſt before the Face of thy Creator. The Leaves of all the Trees in the World; the Sand of all the Seas, all the Stars of the Sky, and the Atoms of the Sun, with whatſoever is created, are all numbered and preſent to him; and canſt thou believe he will forget thy Sins?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wouldſt thou know what the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that thou mayeſt live with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before thou comeſt to Judgment?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is an exact, and particular Regiſter, of thy looſe and wretched Life; all that thou haſt ſaid, ſeen, done, and thought, in ſeventy Years of thine age, is perfectly ſeen to God, in that inſtant, as if thou wert but then in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98258:41"/>6. O Jeſus, my Lord and my God; is it then all one thing with thee to behold, and to judge? And is thy Judgment, the perfect and particular Sight of all the Sins and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of our whole Life? Alas! Alas! What then ſhall become of me, at that Day? Is it poſſible, O my great God, that thou ſhouldſt then ſee all my Crimes and ſoul Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds? That thou ſhouldeſt then ſee all my Subtilties, Deceits, and Falſhoods? Muſt all my beaſtly Vices, and filthy Senſualities, be ſeen by thee at that Judgment; with the Pride, and Preſumption wherewith I have deſpiſed, and trampled upon others; with my unjuſt cenſurings, and raſh judgings of my Neighbours, and my Vanity and Folly in thinking better of my ſelf then of them? Shalt thou then ſee the Sins, not only of my Perſon, but likewiſe of my Office, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? My Sins of Omiſſion, as well as thoſe of Commiſſion? The Evils I have done, the good Actions I have left undone, and my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering others to act thoſe Crimes, which I might have hindered? Muſt thy pure Eyes, which cannot behold Inquity, ſee and behold, and judge all mine Iniquities in that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? How can I but tremble, to think that thy holy, and heavenly Eye ſhould ſee ſuch filthy Impurities, and ſuch horrible Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? What can I hope for in that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? What can my Wickedneſs expect from thy eternal Juſtice, but everlaſting Torments? All my Bones quake for fear, O God, and I<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98258:41"/>am ready to wiſh the Rocks might hide me, and the Hills might cover me from thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but I know how vain that is, and that even in the Center of the Earth, thy Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand will find me out, I am therefore plainly convinced that there is no refuge for me, but from the Bar of thy Juſtice, to the Bowels of thy Mercy. Yet how ſhall I dare take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary there, having ſo much abuſed it? Now, I diſcover the neceſſity I ſtand in of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to plead there for me; yet dare not beg his Interceſſion, having ſo long neglected it. Thou of thy infinite Mercy, and Goodneſs, haſt given thine own dear Son, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus to be that Mediator for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and in him ſome beams of Hope begin to comfort me, remembring his exceſſive Love that willingly died upon the Croſs, to make Satisfaction to thy Juſtice for the Sins of all. But with what confidence can I hope in him whom I have ſo often crucified afreſh by my redoubled Offences! This is my ſad Condition, and when I look only upon my Guilt, I am almoſt ready to deſpair. But Lord, I know that that is a greater Sin than any I have yet committed; therefore I will hope even againſt hope; and carneſtly beg of thee, O my deareſt Saviour, that ſince thou haſt hitherto given me time, and now ſo loudly calleſt me to Repentance, by this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Meditation of God's vigorous Judgment; I may not delay a Moment longer, to lament and bewail the Multitude of my Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98258:42"/>Grant I may go to that great Day, with Tears of Contrition, and that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, with Songs of Praiſe. Grant I may go to it, weeping for having offended thee, and that I may come from it with joy for thy having pardoned me. And ſince thou ſeeſt my ſins which provoked thy Wrath, grant thou mayeſt alſo ſee my Repentance, to obtain thy Mercy. Grant, O dear Jeſus, that ſince thou ſeeſt my Ingratitude, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alſo ſee my Heart deeply grieved, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for having been ſo ungrateful: And laſtly grant I moſt earneſtly beſeech thee, that I may ſee thy infinite Pity, interpoſing the Merit of thy Death, thy Blood, thy Croſs and Paſſion, between thy Father's Juſtice and my ſinful Soul, now and ever; and moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in that great and terrible Day; and that in the mean while, I by thy Grace may ſo ſpend the reſt of my days in Sorrow and Amendment of Life, that at my Death I may be received into thy Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>Of the Means there are in this Life, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Account and Judgment of the other.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Am ſtricken with amazement, ſtand trembling at the thought of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord. I know not what to do, nor can find any way how to eſcape them. I am aſhamed and confounded to appear in his preſence full of ſo many Miſeries and Sins. Is it not poſſible to delay it? Is there no remedy againſt this Evil, nor defence againſt this Danger?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Evil is not in being judged, but in going unprepar'd to Judgment. This immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, hath an eaſy, plain, and ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, by the Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>And that is for a Man to judge himſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times, before God judge him once for all. Wouldſt thou not be afraid of the Judgment, nor of that dreadful Sentence? Judge thy ſelf before hand; examine thy ſelf, before thou comeſt to be examin'd; call thy ſelf frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a ſtrict account; humble thy ſelf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy Life; and at the ſight of thy Sins, pray, and weep, and thou ſhalt go willingly<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98258:43"/>to Judgment, and come off ſafe with thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Serve thy Judge, love thy Judge, and obey him in all things, before he come to judge thee; and thou ſhalt go contentedly to his Judgment, and find thy Judge to be thy Friend.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that many Saints have deſir'd, that their Life might be ſhorten'd, that their Death might be haſten'd, and that they might come to Judgment thereby to enjoy God. They deſir'd to be diſſolved, and to leave this mortal Tabernacle. They deſir'd this knot of Life might be untied, and to be free from the Priſon of this miſerable and corruptible Body, to ſee their God, their Creator and Redeemer; whom they loved, ſerved and ador'd while they lived in this World. They eſteem'd Death, as Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it freed them from a dying Life, which delay'd their enjoyment of an eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They could not paſs to the beatifical Viſion of their God, without going by the way of the Judgment and Sentence. They did as it were die, with an eager deſire of dying; and joyfully embrac'd that Death, which brought them to behold the kind, the cheerful, and beautiful Countenance of their loving Judge. They knew they were to be judged by their Father, their God, their Creator, and Redeemer, their faithful Friend and their moſt gracious Lord. They loved him in their Life, they ſought him by their Death; they ador'd him in the Judgment, and with an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his infinite Pity, they hoped for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Sentence. They knew their offences
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98258:43"/>were many, but they had bewailed them; they knew though they were Sinners, they had lived deſirous to pleaſe him, diligent to ſerve him, and with care not to offend him. They knew they could not put their cauſe into better hands, and that the ſame Perſon was to judge them, who had ſhed his Blood for them, and given his Life upon the Croſs for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. They went to offer their Works, their Tears, and their Repentance unto God; yet without truſting any thing in their Works, they relied wholly upon the Goodneſs of God and the Merits of their Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For though it be juſt, that the Judgments of the Lord ſhould be fear'd; yet it is as juſt that they ſhould be loved. My Father (ſays the holy Soul) is to judge me; what am I then afraid of? My Lord and my God is my Judge; How can I chooſe but hope, and truſt in my Lord and my God, though he be my Judge? If he have a kindneſs for me, and I have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for him; What can I look for in the Sentence, but Mercy and Compaſſion? What Son is afraid to be judged by his own Father, if he hath not lived and acted as an Enemy to his Father, or if he hath bewailed the time that he was his Enemy? What Wife, is afraid to be judged by her tenderly affectionate Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if ſhe hath not been an Adultereſs, or hath heartily lamented that Injury, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently begged pardon of her dearly loving Husband? What Friend is afraid to be judged by his Friend, if he hath been faithful to him,<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98258:44"/>or hath ſhewed a real grief for the breach of his Fidelity? Though I be afraid and wretched, ſays a ſick Soul, I have been deſirous to ſerve thee, O my God, thy Precepts have been my Direction, and thy Counſels have been my Rule, if not in the execution, yet at leaſt in my intention and earneſt deſire. I hope for mercy from that eternal goodneſs of God my Creator and Redeemer, who dyed upon a Croſs for my Salvation. He that was ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and ſo loving in Redeeming me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a ſweet and tender Father in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe are the breathings of a Holy Soul; Thus ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> and many others when they deſir'd to be diſſolved, that they might come to the preſence of God; and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, did not fear to put their Cauſe and Sentence into his hand. They feared his Power, and they adored his Power: They were afraid by reaſon of their ſins; and yet they hoped, knowing his mercy and loving-kindneſs. Their love conquered their fear, becauſe their hearts were inflam'd with that perfect Charity which caſts out fear. And thus, if thou doeſt deſire to have a holy and aſſured hope, humbly reſign'd and yet chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Judgment, and in the Sentence; do that which the Saints have done, and thou ſhalt hope, as they have hoped.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Make account in thy life-time of that Account thou art to give hereafter; I repeat it to thee once again, keep a Judgment-ſeat
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98258:44"/>within thy ſelf every day, till thou comeſt to thy laſt. Judge thy ſelf ten thouſand times, and conſider in what ſteps thou treadeſt, for according to what thou doeſt in this World, thou ſhalt be judged in the other. Strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy very thoughts, and mend what thou ſhalt find amiſs: For by this means, thou ſhalt increaſe that love which caſts out fear. Do thou judge thine own Actions, before God judges them; beg light of him to ſee and know them, and tears to bewail them; and ſo with a holy reſignation, and with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence thou mayeſt appear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Take good heed to thy Words, Thoughts, and Actions, and ſquare them by the Rule of the Divine Law, and of the Will of that Lord, who is to Judge thee; and ſtrive in this Life to obtain Mercy and Pardon for thy Sins and Miſeries.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Be careful to purifie thy Underſtanding, and to purge it from evil; fill it with honeſt and ſpiritual Conſiderations; cleanſe thy will from corrupt Deſires, and fill it with the love of thy Creator. Let thy Memory be the Store-houſe of Holy Meditations, and then, hope and truſt; love and adore the Judgment of the Lord. His goodneſs does more deſire to Pardon thee, than thou doſt to be pardoned; He is more deſirous of thy Salvation, than thou art to be ſaved. He is more deſirous to deliver thee from that Infernal Dragon, than thou art to be delivered. Be careful (I warn thee once again) on what hand thou liveſt<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98258:45"/>in this life, for on that hand thou ſhalt find thy ſelf when Death carries thee from hence.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Fear the Judgment of the Lord, for it is very juſt ſo to do; fear, humble thy ſelf, and tremble; but yet hope, and be more afraid of the ſins wherewith thou offendeſt him, than thou art of his righteous Judgment. Thy fear of his Judgment is ſo great, becauſe that of thy Sins is ſo little. Thou liveſt in a courſe of wickedneſs, and committeſt thy wickedneſs with boldneſs, and even with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, and then thou art afraid to be judged; and that is becauſe thou art to be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But thy chief and principal fear ought to be that of offending ſo ſevere a Judge; and thy chief and principal hope ought to be that of being judged by ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and ſo loving a Father. It is the part of an unfaithful Servant, not to dare appear before his Maſter's face; and though he fears him, yet he does not love him: But a good Servant is glad to come to the Preſence of his Maſter. Every Call of his is a joy to him, every Command a comfort, and he runs chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to wait upon him, at every knock; but an evil Servant is afraid to ſee him, becauſe he was not afraid to offend him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Every ſin thou committeſt, unleſs thou repent of it, is a rigorous Sentence againſt thy ſelf; every guilty action, and every wilful tranſgreſſion is a Criminal Article, whereof thou accuſeſt thy ſelf at that Tribunal. How<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98258:45"/>is it poſſible for thee not to tremble and dread the Judgment and thy Account in the other Life, if thou liveſt without Judgment, and without Account in this? Repent therefore, pray and weep; love and ſerve thy Judge here, that thou mayeſt find him kind, gentle, and gracious hereafter. He is a Judge that ſuffers himſelf to be gain'd in this life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe means to win his favour before he comes to Judge thee in his anger, for thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlighted and neglected to get his favour when thou mighteſt have done it. Tremble with apprehenſion to ſee him in his wrath, who may yet be appeaſed by the means I have ſhewed thee, and who being reconciled, firſt fills the Penitent's Soul with tranſports of his Love, and after with thoſe Joys and Pleaſures which are at his right hand for evermore.</p>

Who can chooſe but fear, to ſee the Sun covered with a deadly Vail, his light obſcured, that of the Moon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, the Stars alſo falling from their places, and overwhelming the Generations of Men. Nothing to be heard but publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Lamentations, Cries, Sighs, and Groans; nothing to be ſeen but Fears, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Loſſes, Miſeries, and Confuſions.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:98258:46"/>3. Can any one chooſe but be affrighted to ſee the dead riſe again by God's Command, at the ſound of that horrible Trumpet, to take up the conſumed and ſcattered pieces of their Body, to cloath themſelves therewith, and each one unite it to his Soul, that he may appear at the dreadful Judgment-ſeat of God, waiting for the Sentence, either of Eternal Life, or of Eternal Death? Who can chooſe but be amazed with fear, to ſee the Almighty cloathed in Majeſty, to come down with the Court of Heaven, armed with Juſtice, to be exerciſed againſt ſin and wickedneſs? Who would not be diſmayed, to ſee the Creator hurle flames of fire againſt all he hath created; to ſee Houſes and Cities, Palaces and Kingdoms burnt together; and finally, to ſee the whole World deſtroyed in that cruel and dreadful Conflagration? Who would not even dye with fear, to ſee ſo many Angels, and ſo many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils together divided from one another, on the right hand, and on the left; expecting the word of Sentence to be put in execution? The Angels carrying the good to Eternal Joys, and the Devils dragging the wicked to Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How is it poſſible not to fear a Tribunal ſo dreadful, a Judgment ſo terrible, and a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſo formidable; from whence there is no Appeal, and the Execution whereof is either Life Eternal, or Death Eternal, for ever, for ever, for ever; ſo that they ſhall know no end of that ever, ever, ever? My Soul is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98258:47"/>and amazed in the conſideration of the Univerſal Judgment: It is diſmayed to think, and to imagine all this which is but as a Dream, thus repreſented to us in writing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what it will be, and of what we ſhall ſee it in effect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Grant, O Lord, that I may tremble, bewail, lament, and ſigh deeply for my ſins and wickedneſſes, before I hear that killing Sentence pronounced againſt them by thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine lips. Grant that my Tears and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, my Sorrow and Contrition, may make my polluted Soul fit to be waſhed and purified by thy moſt precious Blood; to the end I may never hear that confounding word, <hi>Go ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into eternal fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. O give me grace to imitate the Martyrs in Faith, the Confeſſors in Hope, and the Bleſſed Virgin thy moſt holy Mother, and all the reſt of the Saints in Charity; to the end I may hear that moſt ſweet, and moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come call of, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Oh that I had never offended thee my deareſt Lord, that I might not ſee thee offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Oh that I had ever ſerved thee, that I might ſee thee appeaſed! Mercy, ſweet Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, mercy in this Life, that I may find it in the Judgment, and in the Sentence of the Life to come! Prepare me, O Lord Jeſus, for my particular Judgment, that I may be able to

Have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me, when thou ſhalt Judge me alone, to the end thou mayeſt have mercy upon me, when thou ſhalt Judge me and all the World together. O grant I may live with ſuch care to judge and call my ſelf to an Account in this Life, that the remembrance of that other which I muſt one day give to thee, and my earneſt endeavour to make my ſelf ready for it, may never depart out of my mind.

                  <head>Of the Torments of Hell.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. OH, what terrible things are theſe; Death, Judgment, Account, and Sentence, without any Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are things more terrible than all theſe, and they are, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be damned, and to ſuffer the Torments of Hell to all Eternity. Death is Life, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Joy; the Account is Pleaſure, and the Sentence is Delight, in compariſon of what it is, to depart from thence condemned to be thrown eternally into Hell and Damnation; and to ſuffer there, thoſe intolerable pains, which a ſinner hath deſerved here. This is that which makes Death terrible, Judgment formidable, the Account inſupportable, and the Sentence dreadful. Actions are meaſur'd by their Succeſſes, and Cauſes by their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they had condemned me to lye for many years in ſome ſtrait place, and ſome nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Dungeon, and always in obſcure dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98258:48"/>where mine eyes ſhould never ſee the Light, that were a great Evil; but in Hell, the darkneſs is far more horrible, without the leaſt hope of light.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they had condemned me for ever, to ſuffer extremity of Torment, though but in one Hand, in one Foot, or in any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member; that were a great Evil: But in Hell, the whole Body and Soul ſuffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without having one part or Member free to comfort another, and all of them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ever! and ever!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If they had condemned me to ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate pain of ſenſe, and ſuch as might have been endur'd, leaving my Thought and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding free; yet that pain being for ever, would be a very great Evil; but that in Hell is far greater, for the pains that are ſuffered there, are unmeaſurably ſharper, both in their intenſion and extenſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If they had condemned me to lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gally-Slaves, Traytors, and Murderers, the vileſt and baſeſt of Wretches; men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Life, and worſe Manners; this were a great Evil, to be tyed to ſuch ill Company. But they condemn me to be amongſt utter Enemies, who not only abhor, but would fain deſtroy one another, and themſelves too; to hear nothing elſe but Yellings and Blaſphemies, to ſee none but Tormentors executing their Rage, and their Revenge upon the damned, by a death that knows no death, and an end<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98258:49"/>that is ſtill beginning; and which keeps it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration even in the midſt of Torment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If they had condemned me to ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited time, though it were for a hundred years, to ſuffer ſuch ſharp and terrible pains; that were a great Evil, ſince we ſee that one year of acute pain is inſufferable; how much more then for millions of millions of years? But for ever! for ever! for ever! to ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable and remedileſs Miſeries and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have no end nor limitation, but muſt laſt eternally; who can be able to ſuffer and undergo them?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If they had condemned me to all theſe Sufferings in my Body alone, leaving my Soul free, that I might feel no more Affliction than what is cauſed by the Puniſhment of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that were an intolerable Evil; but the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is felt within, is greater than that without; and more inſufferable is that exceſs of grief and anguiſh, which the never dying Worm of Conſcience gives unto the Soul, than all the pains and torments which are laid upon the Body. Theſe are, as it were, the body of Hell; but the ſoul of it, is the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul; far more intolerable and diſconſolate. Yet this is but a ſlightdraught, a very remote and faint deſcription of Hell in general; conſider it now in particular.</p>

                  <head>The Second WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Place of Hell.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider now the Place of Hell; the Habitation of Devils, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible dwelling of the Damned; A dwelling, that is no dwelling; a habitation, that is no habitation; a place, that is no place, but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, darkneſs, fire, torment, and confuſion. There is nothing in thoſe unhappy Priſons that ſpeaks order; there is nothing that ſpeaks diſtinction; all is diſorder, all is contrariety; all flame, and yet all obſcurity. All that is ſeen there is fire and flame, which do torment, but not enlighten. The Place where thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wretches are condemned, is Sorrow; their Reſt, is Affliction; their Food is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and their walk, a paſſing from one ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pain, to another more intolerable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lodgings of that horrible Palace, are Racks and Tortures; the Halls and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries are fire and its continuance; the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Cloſets, are vexation and anguiſh; the Windows are darkneſs, and the Light, is to ſee nothing but miſeries and woes. Think what they ſhall do and ſuffer there; who here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their care, and ſpend all that Money
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98258:50"/>which they owe to the Poor, in ſumptuous Buildings, in ſtately Appartments, in coſtly Furniture, in curious Pieces, and in rich Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nature does require eaſe, comfort, joy, light and cheerfulneſs, but the Damned ſhall there find pain, affliction, grief, ſadneſs and obſcurity. How much does a Man ſuffer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dark Dungeon! Nay, how tedious it is to ſuffer an eaſie Bed, if a Man be kept there but two or three Years, nay but two or three Days, by any ſharp infirmity; his wearineſs makes it a ſevere and a heavy Puniſhment! How much does a Man ſuffer being faſtened to the Bank of a Gally, a Chain at his Foot, an Oar in both his Hands, and his Shoulders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cruel Laſhes! But alas, how ſpacious and lightſome are Dungeons! How pleaſant is a ſick Bed! and how delightful are Gallies, and the ſharpeſt Pains of this mortal Life, in compariſon of thoſe unutterable Sufferings of the Damned in Hell!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Man's Nature deſires fair Houſes, large and cheerful Appartments; but that is a place ſtrait, cloſe and narrow, for the pain of it; and only great, wide and ſpacious, in the laſting of that pain. Nature requires room and liberty to walk; to dilate the Heart and cheer the Senſes; but that is a place where the Limbs have no Motion, the Heart no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and where the Senſes on all ſides, meet howlings, tortures, griefs, ſtenches, fire, and confuſion. Nature requires a place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98258:50"/>and recreate it ſelf: But that place is all miſery, and diſcomfort, torments, and more torments; Loſſes, Sorrows, and Sufferings, without end, without meaſure, and without remedy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Finally, the place of Hell, is a place of calamities, even beyond all imagination, and of extremity of tortures for an eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Its limit, is to repeat eternity; it ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be, is a new beginning; and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al repetition of torment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now all this being ſo; is there any one that believes it, who would not ſuffer here, to the end he may not ſuffer hereafter? Woe be to thee, and me, if we do not conſider here, and endeavour to prevent what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and what expects us there! Woe be to thee and me, if we do not examine, weigh, and bewail the times, wherein we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that eternal Judge, who condemns the moſt part of Mankind to that infernal abode, for not conſidering theſe things here while he gives them time to do it, and for neglecting his many calls, both of mercy, and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thereby making Hell to become their own choice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Is it poſſible, O my Jeſus, that I have choſen that horrible place, by chooſing Sin, and continuing in it! Yes; for God ſet before thee Life, and Death; Bleſſing and Curſing; and left the Election to thy ſelf. Why then, Lord, if I have hitherto choſen Death, and that accurſed place by ſinning; grant I may<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98258:51"/>get out of it, before I go into it; and that by repenting, by forſaking my ſins, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thy poor Members, I may gain thee to be my Saviour; and at the laſt day be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thee with thoſe comfortable words, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepar'd for you from the Beginning of the World.</hi>

                  <head>The Third WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Company of the Damned, and of their pain of Senſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IF that terrible Abode, were only a wide empty ſpace, though ſad, obſcure and afflictive to the Wicked; yet without ſuch ill Company, it might be more tolerable: But the fierce and cruel Inhabitants, and their hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Company, is worſe and more intolerable than the place it ſelf. None but Devils, and damned Perſons are the Neighbours of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal City. The Devils that are buſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Tortures, and the damned moſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in ſuffering them; raging and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with incredible Fury. Nothing is heard there, but the noiſe of the Laſh, and the cry of thoſe that feel it; a ſighing without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, a groaning without eaſe, an eternal Woe,<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98258:51"/>and alas, an endleſs weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Lamentations, are Oaths, Curſes and Blaſphemies; they rage, deſpair; and they belch out Vengeance, without Revenge, and Wrath without Satisfaction. O good Jeſus! The hearing of one Curſe, the hearing of one Blaſphemy, is ſufficient to pierce a Heart and afflict a Soul; What will it then be, to hear ſo many horrid Curſes and Blaſphemies? This may be reckoned the very Hell of Hell it ſelf. But alas! Lord, the Damned do not only hear and ſuffer them, but alſo utter them, and that is yet much worſe, and more to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. Rather, O Lord, let me ſuffer a Hell without pains; but without Sins and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; than a Hell of Sins and Blaſphemies, without any other pain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that unhappy and calamitous City, and among thoſe wretched Citizens, all their Peace is Diſcord; all their Quiet, War; all their Comfort, Anger, all their Order, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, Diſagreement, and Confuſion. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thou didſt behold a City where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants went up and down killing and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, with Swords and Fire-brands in their Hands; here loud Complaints; there louder Cries; here Rage, there Death, and Deſperation. Such a place, were peaceable, and quiet in compariſon of the Hatreds, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Diſcords that are in Hell: For thoſe at laſt come to an end, when the Inhabitants have made an end of one another: But theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98258:52"/>inſtead of ending, are always beginning a new. The Sufferings of thoſe have ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and limitation, but theſe have no degree below infinite, nor any limit ſhort of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and finally, the Companions, Friends and Neighbours of that diſmal Abode, are only the Devils, and the Damned, moſt inveterate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hating and abhorring themſelves and one another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Think how the nice and delicate Perſon will be able to endure this ſurly boiſterous Company, who by being uſed to ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can croſs his tender Inclination, is become too haughty, and inſolent to bear the Company of his own Family, or ſo much as bear with patience the attendance of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. How will the proud, ſcornful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Woman, endure to ſee her ſelf encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Devils, and with Souls as proud and imperious as her ſelf; who cannot endure the Company of that Husband, which God has given her? How will the tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, be able to ſuffer ſo many Devils to be his Superiors, and to tyrannize over him, who cannot ſuffer his Inferiors, though Loyal and Obedient, to live quietly under him? And how will the rebellious Subject, be able to ſuffer ſo many infernal Princes, to exerciſe over him the Empire of their cruel Wills, who never can ſuffer one good juſt and moderate Sovereign, ruling him according to the Laws?</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:98258:52"/>5. Oh, if thou didſt turn the Eyes of thy Conſideration another way, and didſt ſee looſe and ſenſual Perſons, inſtead of the delightful Embraces of their luſtful Lovers, embraced and inflamed by Vipers and fiery Baſilikes, and ſuffering unexpreſſible Torments, without any remedy or comfort; If thou didſt ſee the Scornful, the Proud, the Haughty, trampled upon by Devils, dragg'd and deſpiſed by them, and burning in unquenchible Fire; If thou didſt ſee the ambitious Graſping at the top of Flames and Smoak, and for ever ſuffering the Thirſt, which that of their ambition kindled here in ſo ſhort a Life; If thou didſt ſee the rich covetous Miſer, in eternal beggary and nakedneſs, without any other plenty but of Fire, Torment, Anguiſh, and Affliction; If thou didſt ſee the beautiful and laſcivious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe Sins and Vanities carry her to Hell; there become ugly, loathſome, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; her Body parched with flames and her Soul racked with vexation and deſpair; If thou didſt ſee the debauched Clergy-man, who inſtead of guiding Souls to Heaven, by his Doctrine, brings many to Hell by his evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, tormented there in living Flames; his holy Orders much increaſing his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what was here his Honour, and his Ornament, becoming there the greateſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his Crimes; If thou didſt ſee the Glutton, and the Drunkard, the Epicure and the Libertine, there hungry and thirſty, lean and pale, all their Delights reduced to Fire<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98258:53"/>and Brimſtone, without one drop of Water to cool or quench their thirſt; and inſtead of their delicate meats to be now devoured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and gnawed for ever by the Worm of their own Conſciences; If thou didſt ſee all this, and heard'ſt ſo many ſad Cries and woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lamentations; ſo many Curſes, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Confuſions; If (I ſay) thou didſt ſee, hear and well conſider all this; Ah! how much more careful would'ſt thou be, to ſee, to hear and to live otherwiſe than thou haſt done hitherto. Therefore, go down into Hell by conſideration, while thou liveſt; that thou mayeſt not go down into it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, when thou dieſt. Look well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it thus; and behold it now, to the end thou mayeſt not be thrown into it; now by Meditation, to the end thou mayeſt never ſee it any other way; nor be there compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to feel the weight of God's wrathful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IS there any Evil in Hell, greater than this? Can there be any other greater?</p>
                  <p>Yes, there is yet another, greater, and more cruel than all theſe; and that is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If theſe horrible Misfortunes, Torments, and Miſeries, were to laſt for a Hundred thouſand Years, or for a hundred Millions of Years, and that then at laſt they might have an end; and that there did ſhine ſome glimpſe of hope (though ſo remote) of their being ended, it were not abſolutely Hell. It is no infernal Evil that hath a concluſion, nor can that be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pain of the Damned, which can be ſeen (as it were behind) going away from them. That ever! ever! ever! eternity! eternity! eternity! is the Torment of all the Torments of Hell. To ſhut the door againſt all Mercy, for ever! To bolt and lock the Gates of Hell, and to throw the Key into the bottomleſs Pit, ſo that it ſhall never be taken out of it again! For the Damned to turn their Eyes on every ſide, and find all paſſages utterly barr'd up; to ſee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98258:54"/>the Dungeon not inhabitable, and yet cloſed up on every ſide, and to lie burning, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in it to eternity; this, this is the Evil, of all the Evils of Hell!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Never! never! never to ſee the Face of God! That the Damned ſhall never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to the Light of his heavenly Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance!

That the Devils ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtir from their ſides, nor ceaſe one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to torment them! That they ſhall never be able to think one honeſt thought, to ſpeak one vertuous Word, nor to do any one Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what ſhall be abominably wicked! That they ſhall always go wiſhing, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Death, and yet never find it! That neither the Tormentor, nor the Tormented; nor the Torments themſelves, nor the place of thoſe Torments, ſhall ever come to an end! What is this, good Lord, what is this, but Horror, and Aſtoniſhment?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Ah, how my Thoughts are diſturbed, and even diſtracted; and Nature it ſelf is in amazement, and in a manner loſt, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of theſe Things! How well was it ſpoken of him that ſaid, there were but two ſorts of Puniſhments to be ordain'd in this World for all thoſe that are the Followers of it, and that are deceived by it. One for the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> if he does not believe; and another for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98258:54"/>the <hi>Fool,</hi> if he believes and does not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Is there a Hell for ever? And yet we do we ſin! Is there a Hell for ever? And yet do we not fear! Is there a Hell for ever? And yet do we not repent!</p>
                  <p>Oh! what a Terror is ſtricken into my Soul, by contemplating the Eternity of thoſe Torments; But is it not hard that God ſhould inflict eternal Puniſhments for temporal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences?</p>
                  <p>Oh; take heed of judging thy Judge, who has forbidden thee to judge ſo much as thy Neighbour; how much more then thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! If thou wilt needs be judging, judge thy ſelf, for that thou lawfully mayeſt do; but preſume not to queſtion his ways, for they are unſearchable, and his Judgments paſt finding out. Thou mayeſt as well empty the vaſtneſs of the Ocean, and pour all the Water of it into an Egg-ſhell, as fathom the Depths of his Proceedings, with thy ſhallow capacity. Yet there want not Reaſons to convince thee of God's Juſtice, and to vindicate it from Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity. God ſets before thee Bleſſing, and Curſing; Life eternal, and Death eternal, he ſhews thee the way to obtain the one, and to eſcape the other. He calls upon thee often in his Word, and by his Miniſters to walk in the narrow way that leads to Life; but if ſtill thou wilt go in that great Road, which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt muſt of neceſſity bring thee to eternal Death, thou makeſt it thine own choice, and oughteſt rather to blame thine own choice,<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98258:55"/>and oughteſt rather to blame thine own Folly, than God's Juſtice. He hath ſet before thee Heaven, and Hell, and out of his exceeding love, ſent his own Son, to take Man's Nature upon him, on purpoſe that he might ſuffer Death, to redeem thee from the one; and purchaſe the other for thee. He ſwears, <hi>As I live, I will not the Death of a Sinner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would turn from his wickedneſs and live.</hi> He invites thee earneſtly, ſaying, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways,</hi> and kindly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates? <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> But if after all this method of Mercy, Men will not be wrought upon, but will run on to their own deſtruction, which they are forewarn'd muſt be eternal, it is their own will, not God's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that is to be blamed: Beſides if a Man ſin as long as he can, even to his Death, and would continue to do ſo for ever, if he lived ſo long, which is not unknown to God, who ſearches the ſecreteſt corners of his Heart, and foreſees his moſt hidden thoughts long before; that they are only evil, and that continually; can it be unjuſt that he ſhould be condemned to ſuffer continually? He does what he can againſt God, by his Sin; and may not God juſtly correſpond with him in puniſhment? He never ceaſed from Sins while he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to commit them, and God ceaſes not from puniſhing while he hath power to inflict it, which is for ever. Add to this, that an offence which may ſeem very ſmall againſt an equal, becomes an heinous Crime, if committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98258:55"/>the Majeſty of a King, by one of the baſeſt of his Subjects. And if <hi>David,</hi> who was a great King calls himſelf a Worm, and no Man, humbling himſelf in the Preſence of God; how vaſt muſt the diſproportion be between God's infinite Majeſty, and ſuch a Worm as thou art, being ſo much inferior to <hi>David!</hi> Therefore even the ſmalleſt of thy Sins, committed againſt that infinite Majeſty, muſt needs have an infinite guilt; and ſo may juſtly ſuffer an infinite puniſhment. More Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments might be brought to this purpoſe, but to diſpute thoſe Points is not the buſineſs of this Deſign.</p>
                  <p>This is enough, to ſhew their Error; and teach them to beg pardon for it; beſeeching God to forgive the lighteſt Thought, that can entrench upon his Juſtice, and to give them Grace to make ſuch uſe of this Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe eternal Pains, as may make them careful inſtantly to forſake, and lament their Sins, and totally to apply themſelves to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Mercies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If I have ſtruck a Terror by repreſenting the bodily Pains of Hell, and the Duration of them, how will it move thee ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how far they are exceeded by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Worm of Conſcience, which gnaws the Souls of the Damned; which kills them without ſuffering them to die; and which devours and conſumes them, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, or bringing them one moment near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to their end. This is Hell in the Abſtract.<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98258:56"/>The Pains, and Torments of the Body, ſhew only the outſide of thoſe Veſſels of Wrath, and of that Hell where they are tortured; but the inſide of it, is that Worm of a Man's own Conſcience, and his rage againſt himſelf, for his Sins and Follies. This is the bitterneſs of that Cup of Gall and Wormwood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thoſe Veſſels are filled, they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to drink and ſuck out the very dregs of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Oh what a ſad thing it is, to hear the Damned howling out their woeful Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, grinding their own Hearts with doleful Complaints, and crying out. Ah! wo is me, that had it in my power to be ſaved, and ſo fooliſhly choſe thoſe wicked ways that hath brought me to this endleſs Miſery! Ah! woe is me, how great a happineſs have I loſt! I had time, and means ſufficient, and for not making uſe of them, I am come to ſuffer for ever in this helliſh Dungeon. I was born, and bred a Chriſtian, I had the Sacraments, and other outward Helps of the Church; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I regarded not thoſe advantages, I am now here ſuffering theſe moſt cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I deſpiſed the gracious, and gentle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of my Lord God, and now I am forc't to undergo much harder Laws, and muſt ſubmit to the moſt fierce and cruel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Devils, ſuffering what they impoſe, eternally without remedy! I might have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Examples of the Godly, but I<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98258:56"/>ſcorn'd, and mocked at thoſe that gave me them. I might have forſaken, and wept for my Sins; but I delighted in them, and would not part from them, and now I neither can, nor would repent, neither would it profit me though I could; for ſhould I weep never ſo much for them, tears here in Hell will avail me nothing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I refuſed God's holy Inſpirations, I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd my ſelf againſt the Checks of my own Conſcience. I rejected the Calls and Reproofs of many excellent Preachers, I ſtopt my ears againſt the Advices and Counſels of Spiritual Guides, following in ſpite of all theſe, the Pleaſures of my ſenſual Appetites; and now I ſuffer, and muſt ſuffer eternally thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which by well imploying a little time while it was in my power, I might eaſily have prevented and avoided.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Oh miſerable wretch that I am, What have the Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt ſerv'd me for, but to aggravate my Pains for having deſpiſed them! What have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other holy Myſteries of Religion ſerved me for, but to increaſe my Torments! Oh! how it tears my Soul, to think that for a ſhort and beaſtly delight, I am now thus grievouſly tormented, and muſt lie here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſuffering ſo long as God ſhall be God, without any eaſe or remedy! That my Pains, Miſeries and Torments, muſt never, never have any end! That I muſt for ever, for ever lie howling, deſpairing and devouring my own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98258:57"/>Heart, with malice and envy againſt thoſe that enjoy the Happineſs, from which I muſt everlaſtingly be excluded.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Curſed be the Moment, in which my Mother conceived me, curſed be the Hour in which I was born; curſed be the Parents that begot me; curſed be all the Days of my wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life; curſed be all thoſe that afflicted me to ſin, and accompanied me in ſinning; and curſed be I my ſelf, who by my own fault, and folly have been the procurer of my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation. Ah wretched and miſerable Creature that I am, how much better were it for me, if I had never been born!</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Theſe and ſuch other woeful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, are the Damned continually uttering, and they are heard by God's Juſtice: But the Ear of his Pity and Compaſſion is always ſtopt againſt them. His Juſtice hears them, becauſe it rejoices in making it ſelf ſatisfaction, by the puniſhment of thoſe Sinners that have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: But his Mercy hears them not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they abus'd it, and becauſe the time is paſt, wherein they might and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Oh; but is there no remedy, dear God, no means to avoid ſo great a Miſchief? Yes; and that is to prevent ſuffering, before thou comeſt to ſuffer, and to repent and lament thy ſins before they come to be puniſhed; To weep here, that thou mayeſt not weep there; to take pains in this Life, that thou may'ſt not endure pains eternally in the other; to give<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98258:57"/>and receive Bleſſings here, that thou may'ſt neither give, nor receive Curſes hereafter. To forſake and amend thy Sins and Offences for a ſhort time, that thou mayeſt not be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for them to eternity when time ſhall be no more.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. WHAT diſmal Diſcourſes have theſe been! How ſad and dreadful!</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It muſt be confeſs'd they have been ſo indeed, but by this ſadneſs which is ſhort, we<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98258:58"/>muſt paſs to that Joy, which is eternal. The darkneſs of the Night is followed by the Light of the Day; the Reward is gotten by labour; and the Battle muſt be fought, before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and Crown can be obtain'd. Chooſe which thou wilt, either to begin with Pains in this Life, and end with Joy, which never ſhall have end; or to begin with momentary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and by following them end in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Pains of Hell. Thou can'ſt not avoid one of theſe two Extreams; If thou wilt have the Victory, there is a neceſſity of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if thou wilt fight it is as neceſſary to take pains, and ſuffer. If thou doſt neither fight nor conquer, the Enemy will conquer and captivate thee; and having made thee his Captive, will carry thee to eternal Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To him that overcometh, ſaith God, <hi>I will give the hidden Manna.</hi> This <hi>Manna</hi> is hidden, and therefore it is neceſſary to ſeek it, and to labour and ſweat to find and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. And ſo, before thou comeſt to enjoy that high Kingdom of Glory, where that true <hi>Manna</hi> is to be found, thou ſeeſt it will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely needful for thee to ſtrive, and uſe thy utmoſt endeavours in the Kingdom of Grace. If thou doſt not fight, if thou doſt not conquer here, it will be impoſſible for thee to triumph there.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, who is ſufficient for theſe things? You have given me ſo deep a Senſe of the Miſeries and Frailties of Man's Nature, that I am quite diſcourag'd at my own Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98258:59"/>for how can ſuch a weak and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature hope to get the Victory over ſuch powerful Enemies?</p>
                     <p>If thou wert to ſtand upon thine one ſtrength only, thou wouldſt have reaſon indeed utterly to deſpair of Victory; but our ſtrength is in the Lord, that made Heaven and Earth, and thou art to enter the Combat againſt the Spiritual <hi>Goliah,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did againſt him of <hi>Gath,</hi> in the Name of the living God. Man is apt to think too well of his own Abilities, and to be too ventrous upon his own Strength, and therefore it was neceſſary to abaſe that ſelf-conceit; but if thou haſt really attain'd to that high Point of Knowledge, which makes Men low in their own Eyes, thou art thereby in a ſafer Condition, and much more able to withſtand all danger. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>When I am weak then I am ſtrong,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I can do all things through him that ſtrengthneth me, for our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Thy own weakneſs will make thee rely only upon thy God, an from this knowledge of thy ſelf, thou mayeſt come to ſome knowledge of him. Excuſe not thy Sloth and Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, by laying the fault upon the Frailty of thy Nature; for that is but to accuſe God as an hard Maſter that expects much, where he gives but little. No he expects no more from any Man, than what he enables him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Raiſe therefore thy Courage by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of thoſe divine Benefits he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee; Make clear the Glaſs of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98258:59"/>thy Soul, and in it thou ſhalt ſee God, and ſhalt hear and find him; for although God be in all places by his Eſſence, Power, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; yet is he no where better ſeen and known, than where he is preſent through Grace. What a number of things wilt thou find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee by beholding God within thy ſelf! What Treaſury! What Chearfulneſs! What Joy! What Wiſdom!</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſeeks God over all the World, and ſays of himſelf, That he ſought, but could not find that without him, which he already had within him. He entred into himſelf, and there found what he had ſought, though he could not find it by wandring abroad. If thou haſt God within thy ſelf, in vain wilt thou ſeek him elſewhere. 'Tis within thy Soul, 'tis within thy Heart that this Precious Treaſure is to be found. If not there, then no where elſe. As ſoon as thou findeſt him within thee, thou ſhalt ſee ineffable Lights, and meet with Directions that ſhall guide thee to keep him faſt within thy ſelf, and yet to find him every where without thee alſo. Thou ſhalt learn to truſt him, and by that to fear him. There ſhalt thou ſee the Divine Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, what he has done in thy favour, without thee, above thee, and on every ſide of thee; thou ſhalt find it all there. There ſhalt thou ſee and meditate, what thou oweſt him, and by thy internal and ſuperiour knowledge, thou ſhalt be able to ſee, to ponder, and to penetrate, what before thou neither didſt ſee, nor know, nor love, nor conſider.</p>

                     <head>Of the Benefit of Creation.</head>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt ſee the good he did thee in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee, in making thee a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in giving thee a Soul, and forming in thee an admirable Image of his Heavenly Countenance. Thou ſhalt ſee what he did for thee, in drawing thee out of the Abyſs and Confuſion of nothing, to be capable of all things. Thou ſhrit ſee what he did, in that when it was in his power to make thee a Stone, a Tree, or a brute Beaſt, he made thee a Reaſonable Creature, and capable of God himſelf. Tell me, what hadſt thou done, that could oblige him to it? Upon what merits did this high Benefit fall? Didſt thou perhaps win him to it by thy ſins, which were then preſent to him at thy Creation?</p>
                     <p>Oh how unſpeakable is that Benefit, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in the ſight of Ingratitude itſelf! That God ſhould have all my ſins preſent before him at my Creation, and ſhould yet Create me; that in Creating me he ſhould fix his eyes upon his own Mercy, and caſt my ſins behind his back; this was a goodneſs more wonderful than can well be conceived. The anger of a liberal Perſon grows enraged by the preſence of an ungrateful one, whom he has relieved; and yet here my Creator not only was not angry, but in the ſight of all my Offences beſtowed a Benefit upon me, which it had been much to have granted upon the higheſt Services.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98258:60"/>Behold, how greatly we are indebted to God for Creating us reaſonable Men, at the ſame time he beheld our ſins, making us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to bewail them, and flexible, docil, and diſpoſed (through his Grace) to waſh them with our Tears. By this firſt and principal Benefit he filled us with infinite other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; for in giving us that chief Jewel the Soul, all the reſt, though greater, are leſs; becauſe they all depend upon that.</p>
                     <p>It is more to be a Man, than to be a Great Man. It is more to be a Man, than all that can be contained in the Being of Man. It is much to be Wiſe, but it is more to be Man, than to be Wiſe, becauſe he could not be Wiſe unleſs he were a Man. It is much to be Rich, Powerful, and Noble, but more to be a Man, becauſe he has all thoſe by being Man. It is much to be a King, but more to be a Man, becauſe without being a Man, he could not be a King. It is much to be Good, Holy, and Vertuous, but it is more to be a Man, becauſe he could be none of theſe without a Rational Soul, which makes him to be a Man.</p>
                     <p>Know thy Dignity, O Man, and uſe it with reſpect, and do not abaſe that part of thee, which is Man, to the level of that other, which is but Animal. Let not ſin defile that Soveraign, and that Coeleſtial Majeſty, which thou haſt in thy Soul; for to ſpot, blemiſh, and deface it, is great ſin and ingratitude. To make thee a Man, was to give thee all that<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98258:61"/>is viſible, and to make thee capable of all that is inviſible. What Thanks, what Services do theſe Benefits require? To make thee a Man, was to make thee Head, King, and Soveraign of this inferiour Nature. He choſe thee for Prince of the Planets, of the Sun, of the Moon, and of the Stars. Finally, he gave thee the Elements, all things mixt, and all the ſeveral Individuals, for thy Contemplation, and for thine Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>Thus God's Creating Man, and giving him a Rational Soul, is the chiefeſt and greateſt of all the Gifts he hath beſtowed upon Men; for although afterwards he enriched them with others of his Grace, which are more excellent, yet they all depend on that of Nature. They are Benefits, which fall upon this firſt Benefit, and without which they could be of no Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy or Advantage.</p>
                     <p>But let me not paſs over in ſilence, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to mention in particular thoſe other admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and illuſtrious Endowments, which in Creating thee a Man, and giving thee a Soul, God hath furniſhed thee with, ſo vaſtly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing thoſe of the inferiour, and irrational Tribe; I mean the glorious and ſublime powers of thy Soul, by which it operates; for how do they tranſcend the low Capacities of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Beings? How noble and excellent are thy Faculties, and how wonderful their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in reſpect of the groſneſs and inactivity of theirs?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98258:61"/>Thou haſt an Underſtanding capable of knowing all things, able to draw Inferences from precedent Propoſitions, and to frame Conceptions of univerſal and immaterial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. God hath given thee ability (if thou wouldſt improve it) to penetrate into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt depths of Humane Knowledge, and in ſome meaſure into his Divine Eſſence; thou art able to make ſome diſcovery of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfections, which concentre in him the Original of all Perfections, and to ſoar up by Contemplation into the higheſt Heavens, where this infinite and incomprehenſible Nature moſt eminently reſides. Thou art able from things made and viſible to collect the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the exiſtence of ſome firſt Being, which is the Author of them, and inviſible. Thou ſeeſt the frame of Nature contriv'd in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner, and beholdeſt innumerable Creatures of all kinds, ſome having but Being; others, Being and Life; a third ſort, Being, Life, and Motion; a fourth, Being, Life, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Senſe; a fifth, Being, Life, Motion, Senſe, and Reaſon; and from hence thou art able to infer, that there muſt be a Creator of them, ſince nothing can make itſelf, and ſo proceeding through the whole Chain of Cauſes, thou comeſt at laſt to one firſt Cauſe of all things, which is eternal, ſelf-exiſtent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; and to him thy underſtanding bids thee aſcribe infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, all which Attributes were moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly diſplayed in the Creation of the<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98258:62"/>Univerſe. And further, as by the light of this Principle thou art able to diſcover the Being of God, ſo by the ſame thou art enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thy Duty to Adore, Reverence, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Serve, and Obey him. Thou knoweſt, thou couldſt be made for nothing but for his Service, and that his having made thee gives him a moſt indiſputable Right to thy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Homage; thou knoweſt the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Good and Evil, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not only what is pleaſant or unpleaſant to the Senſes, (which is the utmoſt degree of Knowledge that the brute Creatures arrive at) but alſo what is honeſt or diſhoneſt, juſt or unjuſt, morally good, or morally evil, and art ſenſible of thy Obligations to proſecute the one, and avoid the other; and from hence it is, that thy Conſcience, that internal Witneſs and Judge, ſeldom fails to excuſe and comfort thee, when thou doſt thy Duty, or to accuſe and torment thee with uneaſie thoughts, when thou committeſt Sin. Further, this unvaluable Benefit qualifies thee for Society and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (Bleſſings not known or enjoy'd by the lower rank of Creatures, which are unſociable and incapable of Diſcipline or Order) and capacitates thee for that, which we deſervedly account a moſt deſirable happineſs, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of thy Friends, and of thoſe of thine own kind, without which thou wouldſt be diſconſolate and miſerable.</p>
                     <p>O inexpreſſible Benefit of thy bountiful Maker! deſerving thy moſt intenſe meditation,<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98258:62"/>and the ſervice of thy whole life. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn canſt thou make to God for this ſingular Gift? What requital worthy of ſo vaſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? Has God made thee an Underſtanding Creature, and given thee a Capacity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not only Natural Objects contain'd in this low Sphere of matter, but alſo things ſupernatural above the reach of ſenſe? Let it then be thy principal care to endeavour after an improvement of this Noble Faculty, to employ it about things that are ſuitable to its Dignity, but above all to know God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, which is Eternal Life. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how it imports thee to acquire a due knowledge of thoſe Holy and Divine Truths, which God hath been pleaſed to manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf; and whatever eſcapes thee, ſuffer not thy ſelf to be ignorant or unskill'd in thoſe Sacred Oracles, which contain the will of God to be performed by thee, if thou deſireſt to partake of his Glorious Promiſes, or ever to enter into his beatifick Preſence. 'Tis the Gift of God, that thy Nature is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with this high Ornament and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore uſe it to his Glory, and have a conſtant regard to his Honour in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of it. Let thy whole aim bet to magnifie God thereby, and have a care of diſhonouring him by his own Gift, which he gave thee for thy benefit, but to be uſed in his Service. In a word, ſeek all occaſions to ſhew thy thankfulneſs for it, to celebrate the goodneſs of thy Divine Benefactor, and to<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98258:63"/>ſhew forth his Praiſe by applying it conſtantly to the glorification of his great and venerable Name.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this Faculty of Underſtanding, thou haſt yet others, which are no leſs excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſublime, for which thou art equally obliged and indebted to thy liberal Creator. He has given thee Memory, that Store-houſe of Science, and common Receptacle of all things that are apprehended by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, an Endowment moſt eminently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficial to thee. To this thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt, as to a Guardian or Regiſter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy Judgment or Imagination preſents, drawing it forth again, and remanding it back, when occaſion requires. In this thou treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt up the Images of things, and lodgeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Idea's vaſtly different from each other, the moſt diſagreeable Objects being therein reconcil'd, and joyn'd together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt jarring or diſcord, confuſion, or diſorder; and which is moſt wonderful, by how much the greater the multitude of the Objects is, that are faſtened there, by ſo much the more ſpace there remains for others; and by how much the more thou endeavoureſt to croud and to fill it, ſo much the more it will ſtill hold, it being capable of an infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. From the aſſiſtance of this Faculty thou deriveſt many great and conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. Thou art enabled thereby to reflect upon thy paſt Actions and Follies, in order to amend them for the future; to repreſent things<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98258:63"/>abſent and gone, as preſent before thee; to deſcant upon the Mercies of God, which have been formerly extended to thee, and upon thine own Ingratitude in making him no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for them, but diſobedience and ſin; and remembring how vile thy Practices have been, by this means thou mayeſt conceive an hatred and deteſtation of them, and be brought to Repentance. Finally, by the help of this Gift, thou mayeſt recollect the principal paſſages of thy Life, and recal to mind, what thou haſt done amiſs, which is the firſt ſtep to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Amendment.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore God hath vouchſafed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thee with ſo admirable a Perfection, and to plant in thy Soul ſo uſeful and excellent a Faculty; ſtrive to embelliſh and adorn it with ſuitable Objects, and conſider how thou art obliged above all things to remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and to lay up his Word within thy heart. Remember him who gave thee Memory, and bear in mind thy great Engagement to him for this Benefit. Be careful to treaſure up his precious and ſaving Truths, nor let his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty to thee be ever forgotten. 'Tis a moſt unnatural Ingratitude, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, whoſe Gift it is, that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt any thing elſe, and to let him ſlip out of thy memory, who took care to furniſh thee with that Noble Treaſury, for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of himſelf, and of things that are agreeable to thy Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98258:64"/>Nor are theſe all the Advantages which thou enjoyeſt, from God's having given thee a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul; thou haſt ſtill ſomething of equal Worth and Excellency with the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, deſerving thy Thankfulneſs and Acknowledgment. Thou haſt a Will unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conſtraint or force, which above all other Poſſeſſions is moſt properly thine own, in thine own power, and not ſubject to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal violence. Thy Underſtanding may be taken from thee by ſeveral Accidents and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and thou mayeſt be depriv'd of thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by ſundry Miſchances, but nothing can deſpoil thee of thy Will, or hinder the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of its Operations. Thou canſt chooſe, or refuſe, act or not act, and art exempt from that fatality, whereby inanimate Beings are mov'd: Thou haſt no neceſſity upon thee to determine thy Actions this or that way, nor art thou led by Natural Inſtinct with the Brutes to purſue thoſe things, which make for thy good, but by Election and Choice, having an abſolute liberty, either to follow or reject, what is outwardly repreſented to thee. Thou canſt not be compelled to do ſuch things, as are evil and prejudicial to thee, but 'tis purely thine own act. The Devil himſelf, that great Tempter, can only ſollicit and allure, perſwade and entice thee, he cannot force thee to do any immoral Action, nor all the Powers of Darkneſs; much leſs have men any Authority over thy Will. They muſt obtain thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, before they can draw thee into ſin, and<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98258:64"/>thou muſt will the evil, before thou canſt act it. 'Tis in thy power, whether thou ſhalt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Counſels and Suggeſtions of wicked men, or whether thou ſhalt refuſe to be led by them, nor is it poſſible that thy Will ſhould be driven by compulſion or violence to the proſecution of Objects, which it does not firſt ſeek and deſire.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then the greatneſs of this Gift, and ſtudy how to expreſs thy gratitude to God for it. Since he has made thee Agent, and given thee Election, take heed, that thou direct thy Choice to ſuch things, as tend to his Honour, and thine own Benefit. Be ſure to govern thy Will by the Rule of Reaſon, and let no Paſſions or Temptations prevail to vitiate or corrupt it, for otherwiſe that which is in itſelf a great Bleſſing, will prove to thee a Curſe, and an Inſtrument of Miſery. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou art under a Moral, though not a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reſtraint; that 'tis thy Duty to will only ſuch things as are good and honeſt, though thou haſt power to embrace the contrary. God leaves thee to thy freedom, whether thou wilt obey him by practiſing ſuch Duties as he hath commanded in his Word, and be ſaved; or whether thou wilt diſobey him by purſuing thoſe Vices, which he has forbidden, and be damned. He leaves it to thy choice, whether thou wilt uſe the means that lead to Eternal Life, or to Eternal Death. Be not therefore ſo regardleſs of thy Happineſs, as to chooſe Miſery, and ſo utterly unthinking, as to make<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98258:65"/>Damnation thine own choice. O conſider how much depends upon the due regulation of thy Will, and labour to reſtrain its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded freedom within the limits of thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Apply it only to Vertue and Goodneſs, and thy Reward ſhall be a Crown of Glory, and everlaſting Peace.</p>

                     <p>GOD having Created Man, and perfectly furniſh'd him with ſuitable Faculties, did next provide him a meet Help, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Companion, bleſſing them for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Mankind by the Inſtitution of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; and though it was abus'd by Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, yet Chriſt afterwards reduc'd it to its Primitive ſtate, telling the
<hi>Jews,</hi> that from the beginning it was not ſo, for Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male created he them. He himſelf honoured that State by being born of a Virgin betrothed to an Husband, with whom ſhe lived, as in Wedlock. He honoured it alſo by being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of
<hi>Galilee,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there a wonderful Miracle, which was his firſt. He communicates particular Graces and Gifts to it: Firſt, that of Fidelity to Husbands,<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98258:65"/>to the end, that a Man, who ought to give Example to his Wife, may not run into that which is forbidden, by forſaking that which is allowed him; and to the Woman, that ſhe may not be falſe and treacherous to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And as it is a Bond, which cannot be untyed; ſo nothing ſhould untye the Affections of their hearts. To this Grace of Fidelity and reciprocal Chaſtity, he gives that of Patience, to enable them to bear the burdens of Marriage, which are great; That the Wife ſhould bear the condition of her Husband, and that the Husband ſhould provide Maintenance for the Wife, and that both carrying that holy Yoke upon their ſhoulders, may go on with equal ſteps in the ways of Vertue and Religion, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of their Children and Family with Humility and Prudence. This Patience is the ſeaſoning of that Holy State, without which the married Pair muſt be undone. Where there are Troubles, Patience is neceſſary; as Remedies are, where there are Wounds. The Soul and Body, how cloſe ſoever united, yet are not always at agreement with themſelves, but ever and anon there are Quarrels between them. How then ſhall the Husband and Wife agree always, who, though they be two in one fleſh, as the Soul and the Body, yet they are two ſeveral Perſons, and each in itſelf remains one. One of the great wonders of the Grace of this Holy Inſtitution, is, to preſerve two Perſons of ſeveral Sexes, and often of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conditions and Humours, united together,<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98258:66"/>which is done by Patience. A great Miracle! To live tied to one another with that ſtrict Bond, and yet to act with quietneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, each ſeeking the good of the other, as much as their own. Who, but God, could bring Peace out of Diverſity, and Concord out of Contrariety? And though married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do frequently live in Diſcord, that is not the fault of the Inſtitution, but our miſery and frailty, which throws away the Grace and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which might be receiv'd from it. If a rich man ſhould offer me his Riches, and I turn away from him; Is he ever the leſs rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I refuſe them? If the Sun enlightens me, and I ſhut my Windows, and do chooſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; does it ceaſe to give light, becauſe I will not ſee it? This Inſtitution is light, is holy, is pure. If the married Couple do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to receive it; If they chooſe Diſcord, rather than Agreement; to perſecute, rather than to bear with one another, and to hate, rather than to love one another; this they may do without being married, for there be many that live in Diſſention, beſides Men and Wives; but to live, to agree, to be united in affection, and to have a mutual complyance for ſo long a time as the whole Life, nothing but the Grace of God giving a Bleſſing to them, can effect; as he does in thoſe, who diſpoſe themſelves for ſuch Attainments. Thus if there be diſagreeing Couples, it is becauſe they do not conform themſelves to ſerve and to pleaſe God, who is the Author of thoſe<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98258:66"/>Bleſſings; and if they would but reconcile themſelves to God, they would ſoon be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd in Peace to each other. The Holy Ghoſt tells us, that <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth were righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments, and Ordinances of God blameleſs;</hi> and thence it was, that they lived peaceably together. If the chief Wheels in a Clock be in diſorder, the leſs cannot move regularly. A Bone out of Joynt gives great torment, till it be put into its right place again; and ſo the Man and Wife, being at variance with God, till they be ſet right there, there will be nothing but diſorder and quarrelling between them; but that difference being compos'd, their Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſtate will be a ſtate of Comfort and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and in every reſpect a great and High Bleſſing.</p>

                     <p>Mankind being propagated and multiplyed by the means of that Divine Inſtitution; from hence ariſe in the firſt place Families, which, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves in his Politicks, are the firſt Societies in Nature, the Ground and Original, the Nurſeries and Seminaries of all the reſt; and from them larger Societies, and Bodies Politick. And from this mutual Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fellowſhip, who does not ſee the great good and benefit accruing to Mankind in general? What ineſtimable Advantages ſpring from ſuch an Union and Aſſociation?<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98258:67"/>'Tis certain, by Nature we are all dependent, and cannot live without the mutual Aſſiſtance of our fellow-creatures; we muſt be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others for things neceſſary, without which our very Being cannot be preſerved; and therefore to ſupply thoſe defects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which are in us living ſingly and ſolely by our ſelves, we are even naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſeek communion and fellowſhip with others.</p>
                     <p>And the Benefit of a Sociable Life ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears, in that Nature has implanted in all Men a ſtrong deſire of it, which ſhews it to be in all reſpects advantageous and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for otherwiſe ſuch a deſire had never been ſo univerſally engrafted in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men. Civil Society does more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Nature of Man, than any kind of private ſolitary living; becauſe in Society the good of mutual participation is ſo much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than otherwiſe. Nor indeed are we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a Society bounded within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of our Native Country, but we covet to have a kind of Fellowſhip (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) with all Mankind. Which thing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> intending to ſignifie, profeſſed himſelf a Citizen, not of this or that Common-wealth, but of the World. And an effect of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in us (to have univerſal Fellowſhip with all Men) appears by the wonderful delight men have, ſome to viſit Foreign Countries, ſome to diſcover Nations not heard of in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; and all of us to know the Affairs<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98258:67"/>and Dealings of other People, yea, to be in League and Amity with them. And does not Reaſon tell us, that by this means Traffick is promoted, and when many are confederated, each may make other the more ſtrong? Is it not evident, that by ſuch Confederations and Compacts the general Good is advanced, and the publick Tranquillity ſecured? How is it poſſible for the Intereſt and Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be provided for, without men's being link'd and united in ſuch ſettled Societies, where each Individual is obliged to ſtudy and to conſult the Common Advantage, and every Member to be ſerviceable to the good of the whole Body? And therefore the confounding of Languages was rightly accounted a Curſe to the Old World, becauſe thereby men were rendred incapable of mutual Commerce, and debar'd the great Priviledges reſulting from thence. They became <hi>Barbarians</hi> to each other, and loſt the ſweet Benefit of Society and Converſe, without which all Delights are inſipid, all Order is diſturb'd, and all Safety baniſh'd.</p>
                     <p>And as the Benefit and Neceſſity of ſuch Communions, and Politick Societies is great, ſo conſequently Laws for the maintenance of them muſt be equally neceſſary and beneficial, the juſt power of making which Laws belongs properly to the ſame entire Societies; which having gained a Publick Approbation, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards obtain an obliging force, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come binding to every particular Member.<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98258:68"/>And without this Government and Diſcipline, it is not conceivable, how any Societies can conſiſt; for if, when there was but one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the World, no means of Inſtruction, either Humane or Divine, without poſitive Laws, could prevent the effuſion of Blood; how is it poſſible now, when Families are ſo multiplyed and increaſed on the Earth, but that without Laws, Envy, Strife, Contention, and Violence muſt grow amongſt them?</p>
                     <p>There is no impoſſibility indeed in Nature, (Man retaining his original Integrity) but that Men might have liv'd without any publick Government; but preſuppoſing the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sinfulneſs of Man and of his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, it cannot be denied, but that the Law of Nature doth now require of neceſſity ſome kind of Government; ſo that to bring things to the firſt courſe they were in, and utterly to take away all kind of publick Government in the World, were apparently to overturn the whole World. It muſt be acknowledged that Government is the effect of Sin; but yet that does not in the leaſt detract from its neceſſity or uſefulneſs to Men. Thoſe Laws of right Reaſon, which in a State of Innocency had been ſufficient to direct each particular Perſon in all his Affairs and Duties, are not now ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nor able to ſerve, ſince the Corruption of our Nature, when Mens iniquity is ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly reſtrained within any tolerable bounds; but do require the Addition of other Laws, to which it has always been found needful to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98258:68"/>Rewards, to allure unto Good; and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to deter from Evil. Theſe are the Inſtruments, which uphold the World in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and keep it from running into a State of Confuſion, and Violence. Theſe are the Bridles, which reſtrain the Exorbitant Paſſions of Men, and contain them within due bounds; and theſe alone ſecure us in the Poſſeſſion of our juſt Rights, which otherwiſe we might be depriv'd of by an unjuſt force without a poſſibility of Redreſs. In a word, without this Bulwark and Defence, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but grievances and wrongs, injuries and endleſs diſcord. The World would not be able to ſubſiſt, nor we to live in it without daily Fears and Jealouſies; for whither would not the impetuous and turbulent Paſſions of Men drive them, if they were at liberty to take their full career, without controul or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint? What would not the Wickedneſs of Men attempt, if all things might be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with impunity? 'Tis therefore to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we owe the Poſſeſſion of whatever is dear to us, and for that reaſon we may deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account it a moſt unvaluable Bleſſing, deriving it ſelf from God, the Author of all good Gifts; without which we can have no ſecure enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing that is valuable, but muſt be in continual fears of being diſpoſſeſs'd of it by violent Aggreſſors, who being more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will not diſpute the Right or Equity of the Matter. If the Irregularities and Vices of Men can hardly be curb'd by the moſt ſevere<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98258:69"/>Sanctions and Penalties; what would they not dare to enterprize, if they were exempted from thoſe Penalties, and were wholly left to themſelves, to act as they pleaſe, without fear of puniſhment? What diſmal conſequences would this produce! And therefore we can never ſufficiently extol the inexpreſſible Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of publick Government and Laws, nor yet that God, who has graciouſly enabled us to find out and enact ſuch Laws, as are moſt fit, and expedient, for our mutual Preſervation and Welfare.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <p>TO the Benefit of Creation with all thoſe advantages already ſpoken of muſt be added that of our Preſervation; for if to make thee a Man was ſo great a thing, and to give thee reaſon to underſtand, and means to make advantage of Bleſſing, ſhall it be accounted leſs to preſerve thee from returning again to nothing? It is a great Matter to conquer, but it is no leſs to keep what has been gotten by Conqueſt; That Benefit was effected in a ſhort time; God diſpatch'd thy Cretion in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98258:69"/>an inſtant, but how many Years does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Life, he then beſtowed upon thee, and all that while nouriſh, protect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee? Is this to be leſs accounted of than that? Life and Health are common Bleſſings, (nor yet are they the leſs to be valued for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common) but thoſe perſonal Mercies, which he hath ſhew'd to thee and me, how great, and how many are they?</p>
                     <p>His care in preſerving thee began from the very firſt moment of thy Conception, he quicken'd thee, when thou wert but an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo; He nouriſhed thee in thy Mother's Womb, and preſerved thee in preſerving her, that thou mighteſt not be the untimely Fruit of a Woman, which never ſees the Sun. He kept thee alive in that cloſe Impriſonment, where it was impoſſible for thee to breath, and at the juſt time of Birth brought thee forth into the open Air of this World, where it was impoſſible for thee to live one minute without breathing. Here thou found'ſt ready prepared for thee (the moſt proper Aliment for the Weakneſs of Infancy) two Fountains of Milk in thy Mother's Breaſts, and when thou knoweſt nothing elſe, he made thee know the uſe of them, and taught thee to ſuck, as ſoon as they were preſented to thee, He filled the Heart of thy Mother with ſuch a natural Love and Tenderneſs towards thee, that when thou could'ſt do nothing elſe, but diſturb the Repoſe ſo needful for her at that time, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the thoughts of her own preſent weakneſs,<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98258:70"/>to take care of all things that were requiſite for thee, and thou that wert born more helpleſs than any other Creature, had'ſt by his Goodneſs more helps provided for thee, than all the reſt of the Creatures put together. Thy Fleſh was waſhed from its pollution, thy Nakedneſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, thy feeble Limbs ſwathed to prevent their being crooked and deformed, and when thy Mother broke her ſleep by night, and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her reſt by day, to rock and tend thee, it was he that gave her Ability and Courage to go through with that difficult Task, to ſupport the weakneſs of thy Legs; and made her tire her ſelf with ſtooping, that thou might'ſt learn to go upright, and to ſpeak with a faultring Tongue, that thine might be able to ſpeak plain. What but the Power of God for thy Preſervation, could have made her find a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſo much real pain and trouble? He made her Eye continually watchful over thee, when a ſmall neglect might have been the loſs of thy Life, by any of thoſe accidents, which we frequently ſee happen to other Children. The careleſneſs of a Servant lets one fall out of a Window, another into the Fire, or the Water; how many are maimed or cripled by a thouſand ſeveral Miſchances, but God hath not only preſerv'd thy Life, and the uſe of thy Limbs, but that of thy Senſes alſo, the great Value and Benefit whereof ought to be conſider'd, though we never ſufficiently eſteem it, till we come to feel the want of them;<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98258:70"/>yet their loſs is greateſt to thoſe, that never had them to looſe.</p>
                     <p>For if thou hadſt been born deaf, thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt of neceſſity have been dumb, and ſince nothing can come into the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by the gate of ſome one of the Senſes, whereof the Ear is the chiefeſt for receiving the Notions of Truth and Wiſdom, in what a tedious ſtupid Life hadſt thou lingered thy time out? being by the want of hearing depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the moſt comfortable part of Life, the Converſation of Friends unable to diſcourſe with them, or with thine own thoughts, which would have been empty through the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe things, that ſhould afford Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that pleaſing and profitable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if thou hadſt been born blind, thou would'ſt not only have wanted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all thoſe delightful Objects the World affords, but alſo the eaſieſt and ſpeedieſt way or means of Knowledge. The Eye teaches us many things in an inſtant, which a blind Man can never come to conceive by all the Deſcriptions that can poſſibly be made of them, and the want of Eyes doth alſo in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure take away the uſe of Legs, Sight giving both the occaſion and means of going from one place to another. Thus the loſs of any Senſe is more than a ſingle loſs; and even the want of Smelling, which is the Senſe might beſt be ſpar'd, is commonly accompanied with a great defect in the Taſte, ſo needful for the diſtinguiſhing of wholeſome from tainted<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98258:71"/>Meats, and the Pleaſure whereof God hath added to our hunger, that both of them may daily call upon us to eat for the preſerving of our Lives. For were it not for thoſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements, can we think Men would take all that pains, and be at ſo much coſt and trouble, as they are about their Tables, only out of a care for the maintaining of Life, when we daily ſee them by that very means deſtroy their Health and ſhorten their Lives? more periſhing by Gluttony and Drunkenneſs than by the Sword. Nor hath God only given us an Appetite to eat, and a Pleaſure in eating, but for the ſame end hath alſo given a nutritive Quality to each ſeveral ſort of meat and drink, without which our Bodies could receive no more nouriſhment by thoſe we account the moſt ſubſtantial Meats, nor by the choiceſt Wines, than by pouring Water into our Hats, or by putting Stones into our Pockets.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not have been ſo particular in this Diſcourſe, but to bring thee to conſider and admire, from how ſmall, how weak, how wretched beginnings, by what ſtrange means, and by what wonderful Protections, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God conducts Men through thoſe many difficulties and dangers, which every Year, nay every day, and hour of their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of their early Youth, and growth to Man's Eſtate, they are ſubject to, till in the midſt of theſe they (under his ſupport) attain to that ſtrength of Body, to that ſagacity of Mind, and that undauntedneſs of Heart,<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98258:71"/>which makes them capable of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, and ſeemingly impoſſible underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</p>
                     <p>Behold one, whom a while ago thou ſaweſt lying in his Cradle, unable to ſtir either Hand or Foot, now venturing to encounter the moſt fierce and ſavage Beaſts, and not only taming the unruly Horſe, but bringing even Lions and Elephants under his Subjection. Here Men dig Mines the depth of many Fathoms under ground, and there they build Towers and Pyramids of as many above it. Here a mighty Emperor joins Land to Land, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Bridge over a Bay of the Sea; there a moſt potent King attempts to join Sea to Sea, by cutting a Paſſage of many Miles from the Mediterranean to the Ocean. Behold them leading huge Armies, and cutting through Mountains that oppoſe their paſſage, to ruſh upon Pikes and Swords, as if they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be killed in ſpite of God's Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Thus when Men are grown up to their greateſt Strength inſtead of being more able to defend themſelves againſt thoſe manifold Dangers and Diſeaſes we are naturally ſubject to; they on the contrary have gotten but the more Power, and the more Liberty to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Proſecution of their violent Paſſions. The aſpiring Ambition of one Man, the greedy Covetouſneſs of another, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Luſt, or enrag'd Jealouſie, their inſolent Pride, or their furious Anger, expoſing them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98258:72"/>continually to the Revenge of ſome impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemy.</p>
                     <p>But if God hath given ſome the Grace to govern their Paſſions with more moderation; yet the neceſſary occaſions of their Buſineſs or Calling, may ſeveral ways make them alſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to numberleſs dangers, as of Tempeſt and Shipwracks, of Piracy and Slavery in Voyages by Sea; of Falls, and Precipices, of Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Murders in journeys by Land, and of loſs of Life in the Wars, either by Sea or Land. But if neither their Profeſſion, nor any other accident have engag'd them in theſe, there are Plagues and Famines, Lightnings and Thunders, Conflagrations and Earthquakes, Sea-breaches, and Inundations with divers other publick Calamities, which even Perſons of the moſt quiet and retir'd Condition are ſubject to. Beſides the particular Miſchances of drowning, burning, and many more ſuch like, than poſſibly can be imagined, from which no ſort of Perſons can be exempted; ſo that it is no wonder that Men die, but the great wonder is, when any one lives to be very old, and were it not for the Power of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Protection, the ſight of a very aged Man would be counted little leſs than a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. How many thouſands periſh before or in their Birth? How many have Mothers more hard-hearted than the Eſtrich, which is ſaid to leave her Eggs expoſed upon the bare Rocks, and to regard them no further? Nay, and ſome Monſters much more barbarous, do moſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98258:72"/>cruelly deſtroy their innocent Babes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their own Infamy. How many in their Childhood, how many in their Youth are ſnatched out of this World by one or other of the forementioned Accidents? Not one of an hundred living to forty Years, nor one of a thouſand to double that Age; and for thoſe few that do, their Strength then is but Labour and Sorrow, ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone. Thoſe that dwell in populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are every hour put in mind of this truth by the continual tolling of Bells, and by their frequent meeting thoſe, that are carrying dead Bodies to be buried, every one of which thou art to look upon, as a preſervation of thy ſelf, who hadſt dropp'd into the Grave before them, if his hand had not upheld the weight of thy Mortality, which naturally tendeth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Miſchiefs which ſome do ſuffer, are the Benefits of thoſe that eſcape: Blindneſs, Lameneſs, Crookedneſs, Dumbneſs, Deafneſs, and all Diſeaſes whatſoever another ſuffers, are ſo many Obligations thou haſt to God, that frees thee from them. Their harms are thy Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſince thou ought'ſt to have ſuffer'd, if thou hadſt not been pardoned, all that they ſuffer, who are ſo puniſhed; and if thou haſt not ſuffered theſe Miſchances, how many more, which thou knoweſt not of, would have happened to thee, if God had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd thee from thoſe dangers? His Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Safety is manifeſted to thee in thoſe many miſerable Objects thou ſeeſt about<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98258:73"/>the Streets, ſince without his particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thou mighteſt have been in the ſame, or in a worſe Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Whenſoever therefore thou beholdeſt any of thoſe wretched Creatures, gaſtly pale, and lean with ſickneſs, or almoſt ſtarv'd with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, loathſome with Sores and Ulcers, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Poverty and Beggary; Whenever thou ſeeſt the Members of one conſumed and ſhrivel'd up by Fire, or of another blaſted and withered by Lightning, or finally any of thoſe lamentable Spectacles, from which thou turn'ſt away thine Eyes through horrour, let their Miſery at the ſame time move thy Heart with Compaſſion to thine own Image, and with thankfulneſs to thy God, that thou thy ſelf art not in that woful Condition. Conſider him as a Man of the ſame Nature with thy ſelf, as one whoſe manner of Birth was juſt like to that of the greateſt Monarch; though in this World God hath ſet the one upon a Throne, and laid the other on the Dunghill. Say then, O Lord, this is my Picture, and juſt ſuch an one might I now have been, if thy preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mercy had not put ſo vaſt a difference between us. As I have daily new occaſions to remember this Mercy; ſo let me daily praiſe thee for it with joyful Lips, and with a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart, Lord, that I may make a right uſe of it, and then it will move me not only to pity, but alſo to relieve his Miſery; ſo ſhall we make an exchange advantageous to both, my Soul feeling the Affliction of his Diſtreſs,<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98258:73"/>and his the Comfort of my Alms, and of my Compaſſion. Let me ſtill remember, that I am liable to the like Diſaſters, and be prepar'd with an humble Reſignation to undergo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy fatherly Hand ſhall at any time lay upon me, hoping that if I ſhare with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in his Sufferings here, I ſhall alſo ſhare with him hereafter in the Joys of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom.</p>
                     <p>But the Diſeaſes and Miſeries of the Soul, when they break out to ſhameful and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Actions, are much more loathſome and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable than thoſe of the Body; therefore when thou ſhalt likewiſe ſee any notorious Sinner, glorying in his wickedneſs, as too many do now a-days; when thou ſhalt hear any one abuſing the Name of God, and the Ears of good Men, with horrid Oaths and Blaſphemies, or with prophane Atheiſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; When the disfigur'd Face of one ſhews thee the Marks of his brutiſh Luſt, or the reeling ſteps of another diſcover his ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Drunkenneſs; in ſhort, when any come in thy way that are manifeſtly guilty of thoſe heinous Sins, which yet thou art free from, take heed of thinking thy ſelf good, becauſe they are ſo much worſe, and if thou ſtandeſt take heed leaſt thou fall, and be not high minded but fear, for there was a time when thoſe profligate. Wretches, were as far from ſuch Practices, as now thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to be; Aſcribe it then to God's Mercy only, that thou art not ſuch an one, and ſay, Not<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98258:74"/>unto me, O Lord, not unto me, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, but unto thy reſtraining Grace be the Praiſe, for without that I ſhould have been (nay, and yet may be, if that ſhould forſake me) as great a ſcandal to others, as this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon is to me. Grant, that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the Vice, but not the Man. Convert him, I beſeech thee, from the evil of his ways, and ſo ſtrengthen me in the Paths of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that I may never fall away, but perſevere in them conſtantly unto my Live's end.</p>

                     <p>But is not the Preſervation of the Body from corporal Death much leſs conſiderable, than that of the Soul from ſpiritual Death? Yes certainly. There is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, for the former is only in order to the latter, and when he ſaves us from any ſuch dangers, as thoſe I have before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are to mind us of our Mortality, and to make us think in what condition we ſhould have been, if he had then ſnatch'd us ſuddenly out of this World. His ſparing us longer, was only to give us a longer time to<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98258:75"/>repent, and to urge us to make uſe of it, to the end, that when he ſhall come again to take us away in good earneſt, he may find us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for Death, in being reconciled to him by Repentance and newneſs of Life. Thus in all the occaſions, wherein he delivered me from a Temporal, he delivered me alſo from eternal Death, affording me a longer time to break off, and to forſake my Sins by a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not to be repented of, quick'ning my Faith to lay faſter hold on my Saviour, leaſt I ſhould be pluck'd away from him, as I had like to have been, while I was in ſo great an Error, as to preſume he would be held by me, whilſt I was loath to let go my ſins, as if it had been poſſible to embrace Chriſt, and the World both at the ſame time. How often, when his Divine Majeſty was ready to throw me juſtly into Hell with one hand, hath he detained me with the other? And when I was already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by his Divine Juſtice, how often hath he ſaved me by his Compaſſion and Mercy? How often, when I was going, nay running, to throw my ſelf into the infernal Flames, hath this compaſſionate Lord ſtopt me in my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and freed me from Temptations, which were hurrying me to eternal Miſeries? How often hath he driven back the Devil, who had ſeized me, and was dragging me away, when his Divine Majeſty laid hold upon me, reſcued, ſuſtained, and receivcd me, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my wickedneſs, and embracing me in the Arms of his boundleſs Charity? How often,<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98258:75"/>when being blind and fooliſh I went aſtray, hath he ſought me, and brought me home? How hath he called, advertiſed, reproved, and counſelled me, by which means I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and reſtored? How often, ſometimes ſleeping, ſometimes waking, while I was dead to Grace, but quick to Sin, hath he rouzed me up, called me, and led me by the hand to make me forſake Sin, and return to Grace? Who then bound the Hands of his Juſtice, who entreated for me, when I was lull'd aſleep in that ſinful ſecurity? What was there in me, that I ſhould find more favour, than thoſe, that are taken away from amongſt us in the midſt of their days, and in the heat of their youthful Luſts? My Sins cried out againſt me, but the Lord ſtopped his Ears. My offences daily encreaſed againſt him, and his Mercies abounded as daily towards me. I ſinned and he did expect me, I fled from him, and he followed me, and when I was even weary in offending him, yet his long ſufferance was not weary in expecting me; for in the midſt of all my Sins I received many good Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reproofs from his Holy Spirit, which check'd me in my inconſiderate courſe of Life. How often did he call me with the Voice of Love? How often did he terrifie me with threats and fears, laying before me the Peril of Death, and the Rigour of his Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? How often hath he followed me with his Word preached? How often invited me with Bleſſings, and chaſtened me with Croſſes,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98258:76"/>compaſſing me about, and hedging my way with Thorns, that I might not be able to break from him? By all theſe holy Methods he made me at laſt to ſee the Vanity, the Folly, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs, and even the Painfulneſs of Sin. l found that it was dangerous and coſtly, as well as ſlaviſh to be hurried up and down by the Tyranny of my unruly and vicious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I found I had no fruit of thoſe things, whereof I was afterwards aſhamed, and was at laſt convinced, that the end of them was Death, nay, and death eternal. Then did I fully reſolve (being aſſiſted by thy Grace) with an unchangeable purpoſe, to alter my courſe of Life, and to run the way of thy Commandments, ſince thou hadſt ſet my Heart at liberty. My Soul eſcaped even as a Bird out of the Hand of the Fowler, the Snare was broken, and I was delivered. O let me never again be entangled with the Birdlime of ſinful Delights, from which it is ſo hard to get diſengag'd, but grant I may now ſoar up to thoſe Pleaſures, which are at thy Right-hand for evermore, taking my flight freely to thee, and to the Ark of thy reſt, for the Deluge of Wickedneſs, that hath covered the Face of the Earth affords no ſafe place for the ſole of my Foot, O put forth thine hand to take me in to thee, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the Dove. I come with the Olive-branch of Peace in my mouth, the Merits and Interceſſion of the Prince of Peace. I have nothing elſe to plead, but by them and by them only I hope to be received, and<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98258:76"/>kept from ever departing from thee any more.</p>
                     <p>If thou haſt not been ſo great a Sinner as I, art thou leſs bound to God for preſerving thee from it, than I, for being pardon'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed? Shall the Benefit by thee be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs, becauſe it is really much greater? Does the Hand, that ſaved me from a Wound, do me a ſmaller kindneſs, than that, which cures me, when I am wounded? Or rather is not the benefit of Preſerving much the greater, by ſaving the Blood I ſhould have loſt by the Wound, and the Pain I ſhould have ſuffered in the Cure? For though it require a greater Power to lift me up, when I am down, than, when I am up, to keep me from falling; yet to me the Benefit is more worth, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents me from a Miſchief, than that which gives me remedy, when I am in it.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I ſeen, O God, for how many Benefits I am indebted to thee notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my many Sins, O let not an horrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude be the laſt, and greateſt of them all. Man's Laws have ordained no Puniſhment for that infamous Crime, either becauſe they did not believe, that any thing in the World could be ſo bad, as an ungrateful Perſon, or that they could find no Puniſhment proportionable to ſo great a Crime. The wildeſt and the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Breaſts are grateful to their Benefactors, and good turns have tamed the fierceſt Lions; but we, more ſavage than the furious Beaſts, are ſo far from Gratitude, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98258:77"/>we each moment offend our moſt gracious Benefactor. But ſuffer us not, O Lord, to do ſo any longer; and let the greateſt of all thy Benefits be to make us thankful for them, and with the humbleſt Devotion of our Souls to acknowledge, that the Number of them is infinite, and their Nature moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                  <p>WE are come now to the utmoſt top of all the Divine Benefits, which requires a moſt attentive Conſideration. Our great Creator in the making of Man deſigned a moſt wonderful Union between his Soul, his Body, and his God; Three things ſo vaſtly diſtant, and ſo ſtrangely different, that nothing but Omnipotency could have joyn'd them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for what can be more different than a dead Clod of Earth, and a living immaterial Soul? What can be more diſtant, than a Soul dwelling here below in the narrow Limits of an Earthly Body, and the Divinity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and an eternal God, who dwelleth in the higheſt Heavens, and whom even the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain?</p>
                  <p>In this bleſſed State he was placed in the Garden of Paradice, where nothing was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him, but the Tree of Knowledge; and with this Covenant, that if he continued in obedience, he ſhould never die, but be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from that Earthly to an Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98258:79"/>but <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who from a glorious Angel was become a Devil, having been thrown out of Heaven for aſpiring to be equal to God, envied, that Man ſhould enjoy the Happineſs which he had loſt, and knowing by woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that Heaven could not contain a proud Perſon, he thought himſelf ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Man's being admitted there, if he could but make him guilty of the ſame Sin, Pride. Hereupon he ſubtilly firſt began to tempt the weaker Veſſel, <hi>Eve,</hi> by ſhewing her the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fruit of the forbidden Tree, telling her that by taſting it ſhe might become like unto God himſelf, and when by his perſwaſion he had deceived the Woman, he made uſe of her (as he ſtill does) to deceive the Man. Thus Sin, like a cunning Thief crept in at the Window of his Eye, which he unwarily had ſet open to behold the Beauty of that Fruit, and ſoon opened alſo the Doors of his Ears to admit the Enticement of his Wife, conſpiring with his treacherous Appetite to let in Death at the Gate of his Mouth, by his diſobedience in eating the Apple, which was preſented to him by her. Then that bleſſed Union was broken, and a Separation made not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Body and his Soul, by a temporal Death, the Sentence whereof inſtantly paſs'd upon him, though the Execution was deferr'd; but alſo between his Soul and his God by an eternal Death, to which he alſo became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by liable; and as a Fore-runner of both, he and his Wife were driven out of Paradice<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98258:79"/>from the Preſence of their gracious Creator. Now as the Departure of the Soul from the Body is Death, ſo the Departure of God from the Soul can be no leſs than Hell; for as in his preſence there is fulneſs of Joy, ſo in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there muſt be extremity of Sorrow, and as at his Right-hand there be Pleaſures for evermore: ſo on his Left there muſt needs be everlaſting Pains, and what can the feeling of them be but Hell? To this miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sin brought our firſt Parents, and from them all we their wretched Poſterity became tainted with an original Corruption, the Seeds whereof growing up into innumerable actual Tranſgreſſions afford no other Fruit but Death in this World, and eternal Damnation in that which is to come; but God being infinitely merciful would not abandon them to periſh for ever in this ſad Eſtate, but out of the Bowels of his tender Compaſſion, did with incomprehenſible Wiſdom find out a way for the Satisfaction of his own Juſtice, and for the Salvation of Mankind. It had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible for all of them together to have done any thing in the leaſt degree towards the Salvation of ſo much as one Man, for it coſt more to redeem a Soul, ſo that they muſt have let that alone for ever. But God contriv'd it by an Union much more admirable than that already mentioned, and that was between the Divine and Humane Natures; And
<hi>Adam</hi> had no ſooner broken the firſt Covenant of unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Obedience, which God made with him in<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98258:80"/>Paradice, but he graciouſly made a Second with him and his Poſterity in the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This he afterwards perform'd, by ſending his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, equal to his Father, as touching his Godhead, into the World for the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who being conceiv'd by the Holy Ghoſt in the chaſt Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> became alſo perfect Man, of a reaſonable Soul and humane Fleſh ſubſiſting; to the end that as Man he might be capable to ſuffer, and as God, to ſatifie for the ſins of the whole World.</p>
                  <p>This was a Benefit ſo high, and ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that neither the Underſtanding of Man, no, nor that of Angels is able to comprehend it. Here all conſideration is confounded, and humbles itſelf with aſtoniſhment, to ſee, that the Son of God, to the end that he might cloath thee with his Grace, cloathed himſelf with our Nature, which is a poor, torn, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Garment, full of beggery and miſery; and yet that Soveraign, Eternal, and Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty put it on for our ſake; and though this was exceeding much, yet he did a great deal more for us; ſince beſides this Humanity which Chriſt the Divine Word took upon him, he underwent ſo many Sufferings for Mankind, and wove this ſeamleſs Coat of Grace, (which he gives us in Baptiſm) with ſuch unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble griefs and torments, as never have been ſuffer'd in all the World, but by himſelf, nor ever ſhall be. Nay, he did yet more, for he<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98258:80"/>not only wove this Coat of Grace with theſe unſpeakable pains, but even with his holy death, and would end his Life in that very employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of weaving and finiſhing it, to the end he might give that ſeamleſs Robe its utmoſt Beauty and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Here all our thoughts ought to be Silence, Amazement, Terror, Reverence, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with Tears of Love and Contrition. That the Eternal Son of God, to cloath me with his Grace, ſhould cloath himſelf with my humble Nature, and preſently load him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the burden of my ſins, and then take upon him their Puniſhment upon the Croſs, and die upon it for them! That the cleanſing of me ſhould make him be defil'd with the ſpittings of blaſphemous mouths! That the giving me the Life of Grace, ſhould make him die the Death of Nature, and that in ſuch cruel Torments! That for the waſhing of my Soul, he ſhould ſhed all his Precious Blood! And that he ſhould deveſt himſelf of all Humane Comfort, only to give me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Remedy, and even Heaven itſelf! This is a buſineſs more proper for our Love, than our Meditation, more to make us active in his Service, than contemplative in our Thoughts, and to be expreſſed more by our Wonder than our Words. Yet it is good to meditate upon it, that we may love him; to conſider it, that we may ſerve him; and to ſpeak of it, that by finding we cannot ſpeak enough, we may admire and adore him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:98258:81"/>A Man, that does me a kindneſs, has my Thanks; and if by his pains and danger, he draw me out of any Trouble, I ſhew my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by acknowledging it. There be Laws, that order Recompences for a Subject, that ſaves the Life of his King, in War, or in Peace, appointing him to be rewarded with Wealth, and crowned with Enſigns of Honour.
<hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> only for giving Notice to <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> that ſome of his Treacherous Servants meant to kill him, was by the Command of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then King, cloathed with his own Royal Robe, and his moſt beloved Favourite was made to lead the Horſe, upon which that Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject rode about the Streets of the City. This was an high Honour eaſily attain'd; ſo notable a demonſtration of Favour, ſo Royal and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick a Recompence but for a bare Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſment.</p>
                  <p>Conſider now, if ſo much were due to a Vaſſal, who by the diſcovery of a Traytor, had ſav'd the Life of a King; what ſhall a Vaſſal owe to his King, who not only hath ſav'd him from Death, but, which is more, hath given him Eternal Life, freeing him from everlaſting Damnation, and not at ſo cheap a rate as words, but by ſweating Blood, ſuffering Torments, and giving up himſelf to Death, even the death of the Croſs? Can this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, this Love, this exceſs of Kindneſs, find any in the World, that can be compar'd to it? And if we ſhould be ungrateful for it, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of it, (which in ſome ſort is worſe than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98258:81"/>to be ungrateful) could there poſſibly be a greater wickedneſs? O Lord, ſuffer not me, I beſeech thee, to be guilty of ſo great an Error, of ſo great a Folly, and of ſo great a Wickedneſs; for ſuch a ſtrange want of Love, and ſuch an abominable Ingratitude, cannot be thought of by any good Perſon without horror.</p>

                  <p>COnſider now what God hath done for thee in particular, towards making thee a partaker of this high Benefit of Redemption, for though Chriſt by his death paid a ſufficient Price for the Souls of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet thou (no more than many others) couldſt have had no ſhare in it, hadſt thou not been made a Member of his Body; and how high ſoever the Benefit of Creation be, it had been much better for thee never to have been born, than not to have been made a Chriſtian. But what couldſt thou, a poor helpleſs Infant do towards the attaining ſo great a Benefit, when thou didſt not ſo much as know thy want of it? Yet the Mercy of thy moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God prevented thy deſires, and in his eternal purpoſe he determined thee to be one of that happy number, that ſhould be born of Chriſtian Parents, in that part of the World, where the Goſpel is moſt purely profeſs'd, and<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98258:82"/>where thou wert early conſecrated to him in Baptiſm. Thou wert brought to that Laver of Regeneration, where the ſtains of thy Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption were waſhed away in the Blood of Chriſt, repreſented by the outward and viſible ſign of Water, wherewith thou wert ſprinkled, to ſignifie thy death unto Sin, and thy new birth unto Righteouſneſs: Thou wert baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Saviour's Appointment. By the Gate of that Holy Sacrament thou wert ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church, and made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven; being by Nature born in ſin, thou wert thereby made a Child of Grace. Thus the ſecond Covenant made with Mankind in Chriſt Jeſus was ſealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thee, which cannot fail on his part to be faithfully performed, if thou be but careful on thine, to do the beſt thou canſt, and to ſerve him with ſincere, if not with perfect Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Men uſe to envy thoſe that are born of Noble Parents, whoſe Care, Power, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may ſupport and ſuccour the naked, weak, and innocent Infants; but O! what a Noble Birth is that of Faith? What rich Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Swadling-cloaths are the Coeleſtial Vertues? That this little Creature ſhall no ſooner be born, but that at the ſame inſtant he comes into the care, not of a weak frail Mother, who lies unable to help her ſelf, by<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98258:83"/>reaſon of the Pangs and Throws ſhe ſuffer'd for the bringing of a Child into the World, but of an Holy, Perfect, and Spiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the Catholick Church, that cloaths him with the Robe of Grace, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Pledge of a ſafe and an eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in Glory! That the Child ſhould ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be born, when already the Son of God, as an inviſible Miniſter doth by the viſible hand of his Miniſter baptize, and at the ſame time waſh away ſin from that Soul, and fill it with Graces, Gifts, and Vertues! This is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is indeed deſervedly to be valued, and a Benefit, which can never be ſufficiently admir'd. From the time that the Water of Baptiſm waſhed off the filthy rags of <hi>Adam,</hi> and cloathed thee with Grace in the Blood of the Lamb; ſin, which had wounded thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, became wounded it ſelf; and whereas before it gave death, from that time it ſuffered death. In Natural Sickneſſes, the Remedies ſeldome reach to the Diſeaſes, and the Body, when it is recovered, hardly gets ſo great ſtrength, as what it loſt by Sickneſs; but in the Spiritual Sickneſs, and in the Hurts and Diſeaſes of the Soul it uſes to be much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the wounded party recovers more ſtrength and vigour, when he is gotten up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, than what he loſt by falling into them. The Devil ruined us, but God is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in good, than he is in evil. Sin deſtroy'd us, and Grace renew'd us, but Grace is more effectual to renew us, than Sin to deſtroy us.<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98258:83"/>Our weak and ruined Nature was indebted Ten Thouſand Talents, but the Eternal Son of God hath ſatisfied the Debt, not with Ten Thouſand, nor with an Hundred Thouſand, but with his Blood, a Price of ineſtimable value.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou think that any thing can be more powerful than God? Hath he not received thee into his Church by Baptiſm? And hath not he on his part promiſed to protect, to free, and to aſſiſt thee? Haſt thou not paſſed through thoſe Waters, flying from the Enemy, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued thee? Did not that Red Sea of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's blood open to give thee paſſage? And did it not ſhut again to drown the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> I mean Original Sin? Then what haſt thou to be afraid of? Sing the Victory with
<hi>Miriam</hi> and the Daughters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which the Son of a better and a more glorious <hi>Myriam</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for thee. Is not God thy ſuccour and thy hope? Whom haſt thou to fear? Is not he thy defence and thy protection? What doſt thou dread? When a man is once cloathed with the Grace of God in Baptiſm, all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are but few. By the Infuſions of Grace thou oughteſt to count Sin and Nature to be already conquer'd. What ſignifies the Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee with the Sign of the Croſs in thy Forehead, but the marking thee out for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jeſus Chriſt? Be not therefore aſham'd to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified. Thou art not only his Souldier, but art furniſhed with Arms of his Magazine. The Old Man
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98258:84"/>is put away, and thou art cloathed with the New, and that New Man is Jeſus Chriſt, who enters into thy Soul, to cloath it with himſelf, and with his Graces, for he enters to arm, to defend, to favour, to protect, and to aſſiſt thee. The Field, in which thou fighteſt, is thine own, for he ſtrengthens and encourages thee in all encounters. Thou fighteſt in the Militant Church, whereof thou art a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, againſt which that Enemy with whom thou fighteſt can never prevail. Great part of the Victory conſiſts in the Advantage of Ground, but all is favourable to thee from the time thou art entred into the Church. That Entry by Baptiſm was the firſt Victory, for the entrance it ſelf was a Victory, and that Victory a Triumph. From that day Hell trembles at thee, only becauſe thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and now no body can deſtroy thee, but thou thy ſelf, and thou art told by the Word of Truth, that the greateſt outward Enemy, the Devil, will flie from thee, if thou doſt but reſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thou canſt not but be greatly chear'd with theſe Encouragements, and much comforted by ſeriouſly conſidering what thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Baptiſm. We Chriſtians certainly ought never to loſe the ſight of that Benefit, but ſtill to reflect upon the greatneſs of it with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts. Yet we ought not only to look upon what God hath done for us, but alſo to think upon our part of this Covenant, and to weigh the Duties we are oblig'd to by it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98258:84"/>that thy God fathers and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when thou wert baptized, did promiſe and vow in thy Name, that thou ſhouldſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh; as likewiſe that thou ſhouldſt believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, (contained in the Apoſtles Creed) and finally, that thou ſhouldſt keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Decalogue) and walk in the ſame all the days of thy life. The Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to do this for thee, as thy Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe at that time by reaſon of thy tender Age, thou wert not able to make, much leſs to perform, theſe Promiſes; but being come to Underſtanding thou art bound to take that Vow upon thy ſelf; and they may properly be called God-fathers and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe in the mean while it is their Duty to take care, that their God-Children, as they grow up, may be taught, what a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow, Promiſe, and Profeſſion they have made for them, and to cauſe them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed both in the Articles of the Creed, and in the Ten Commandments. Moreover, if at any time they ſhall hear them ſpeak, or ſee them do any thing contrary to that Divine Law, they ought to put them in mind, that they promiſed and vowed the contrary in their Baptiſm. But O! how little of this care is there in the World! there is nothing more neglected or forgotten than this Duty of<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98258:85"/>God-fathers, yet I hope not generally. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have ſuch hard thoughts, for though I muſt needs confeſs it is too much ſlighted, yet certainly there be many, that have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it. But ſince Children, when they grow to Age, are themſelves bound to perform what was promiſed in their Names by their God-fathers and God-mothers. They may in great part diſcharge themſelves, when they take care, that their God-children be ſo well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, as to know the Duties that Vow engages them to; and when being of years able to renew that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to take the charge of their Souls upon themſelves, they ſhall have perſwaded them upon ſerious conſideration ſo to do, and have brought them to the Biſhop to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, according to that Order, which the Wiſdom of the Church hath eſtabliſhed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing all the Members thereof to be ſo, or at leaſt to be ready and deſirous to be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be admitted to the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The Biſhop, by whoſe Miniſtry this Office is performed, firſt cauſeth the Parties, who are to be Confirmed, to make an open Confeſſion in the Publick Congregation, that they do renew the Promiſe and Vow, that was made in their Name at their Baptiſm, ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming the ſame in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and acknowledging themſelves bound to believe and to do all thoſe things, which their God-fathers and God-mothers then undertook for them. He alſo prays to God to ſtrengthen
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98258:85"/>them by the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, and daily to increaſe in them his manifold Gifts and Graces; the Spirit of Wiſdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the Spirit of Counſel and Ghoſtly Strength; the Spirit of Knowledge and true Godlineſs; and to fill them with the Spirit of his holy Fear for ever. Laſtly, he lays his hand upon each Child, and bleſſes him, as our Saviour did upon thoſe Children that were brought to him, and concludes, beſeeching God to direct, ſanctifie, and govern both their Hearts and Bodies in the ways of his Laws, and in the works of his Commandments, that through his mighty Protection both here and ever they may be preſerved in Body and Soul, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Much are thoſe Parents and Sureties to be blamed, that omit to bring them to this Order of Confirmation, it being a great benefit, both to the Sureties in the diſcharge of their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and to the Children, who are duly fitted and prepared for it, for they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by awakened to an early ſenſe of Religion, and to a future endeavour of performing their Duty in it.</p>
                  <p>When Young Plants are removed out of their Nurſeries, and ſet in the open Field, it is neceſſary to fence them about with Stakes, to hinder their being crop'd or trodden down by Beaſts; and it is no leſs neceſſary thus to confirm and ſtrengthen new beginners in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that they may be the better guarded at their coming into the open World againſt<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98258:86"/>the dangerous approach of brutiſh Men. Such Branches as are ſo engrafted into the true Vine, God doubtleſs vouchſafes to water with his Grace, and though in weak meaſure at firſt, yet if they continue to take firm Root, he will not fail to make them thrive, and bring forth good Fruit. Thoſe gifts of the Spirit prayed for on their behalf, will likewiſe through his Mercy increaſe, till they become ſo many ſtrong Bulwarks to defend their Souls againſt the Common Enemy, within which they may ſtand ſafe to fight according to their Vow, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Remember therefore always the Obligation that lies upon thee by that Vow. We are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in our Childhood to that, which we neglect, when we are grown up; whereas, being grown up, we ſhould be careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that, which our Sureties promiſed for us, when we were Children. Keep then ſtill in mind that thou art a liſted Souldier, forget not in what Army thou art enroll'd, what Captain thou art to follow, what Fidelity thou haſt ſworn to him; and fight valiantly even to the death, rather than ſuffer thy ſelf to be overcome by the ſubtil Perſwaſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of his and thine own Enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers of this World for a very ſmall hire keep Fidelity to their General; they fight and die for him without any other bond or tye, than that of ſome little piece of Money, ill paid, and yet they give their blood, and daily venture their life for that Pay;<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98258:86"/>whereas we Chriſtians, the Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, liſted under the Enſign of his Croſs, aſſiſted by ſo many Benefits of Grace, being Heirs, and Co-heirs of Glory, and having Heaven for our Pay, do frequently deſert our Colours, like vile infamous Cowards, and by ſin treacherouſly fly over into the Enemies Camp. The Souldiers of the World fight to defend their King, or their General, but here our General fights, and gives his Blood and his Life for the defence of his Souldiers. They hazard their lives for a pitiful Pay, which oftentimes they never get; but our King and Captain ſecures us a certain Pay, rewarding us with Life and Glory. If they fly over to their Enemy, 'tis out of hope to preſerve their lives; but if we do ſo, we run to eternal death, and fly from eternal life. The War of the World is made by wounding, hurting, and killing others, but the War of God againſt the World is made by receiving Injuries, Affronts, Wounds, and even Death it ſelf, if it be neceſſary. The War of the World is to Conquer, by deſtroying others, but the War againſt the World is to Conquer by undergoing Difficulties, and Suffering for God's ſake. In that War, it is Force that overcomes, in this 'tis Patience. The Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that War are gotten by pulling down, and trampling upon others, but in this by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing and humbling our ſelves. The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of that War are here upon Earth, and of a ſhort continuance; but thoſe of this War<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98258:87"/>are to be in Heaven above, and to endure for ever and ever. Fight therefore couragiouſly, have patience, and perſevere; the Battle laſts but for a while; thou art already near the Crown, that is to be thy Reward. Arm us, O thou great Captain of our Salvation, for this Warfare with the Shield of Faith, the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the Helmet of Salvation, and with the Sword of the Spirit; and grant that having our Feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, we may chearfully withſtand all Aſſaults of our Ghoſtly Enemies, keeping ſtill preſent in our thoughts, the Vow we made to thee in our Baptiſm, to fight manfully under thy Banner, againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy Faithful Souldiers and Servants unto our lives end.</p>

                     <p>OUR bleſſed Redeemer and Saviour of Souls did not ſtop here; He thought it not enough to Arm us for the Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but has alſo provided a Remedy to cure our Wounds. His Divine Majeſty knew our weakneſs, he knew our proneneſs to Vice, he<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98258:87"/>knew that like Cowards we ſhould ſometimes throw down our Weapons at the feet of our Enemies, and baſely fly from his Banner, for the ſake of ſome filthy Appetite. He would not leave our Souls without help, but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſeeing our Frailty and Miſery, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the very ſight of ſo great Ingratitude, to prepare a Medicine for the cure of our Wounds, and an Antidote for the Poyſon of our Sins, by eſtabliſhing the Doctrine of Repentance, and by giving Power and Commandment to his Miniſters, to declare and pronounce unto ſuch as are truly Penitent, the Abſolution and Remiſſion of their ſins. Great was the Love of our Lord in dying for us upon the Croſs, nor was it leſs in giving us this means to make his Sufferings effectual to us. To pardon paſt Offences has been ſeen, and ſometimes one man to ſuffer for another, but not at ſo dear a Price as his own Blood. For a Perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to ſuffer the ſight of his Enemies, is much, when it is to do them good; but 'tis much more, when he knows that they are not only Enemies, but that they are ungrateful, and deſpiſe his Benefits, to ſhed his very blood to make a Medicine for their Wounds: This is a pity exceeding all Humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>That there ſhould be care taken in Armies to cure the Wounded, and Hoſpitals for the Sick, it is not ſtrange, becauſe they are Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souldiers, and venture their Lives in Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their King: But in the War of the<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98258:88"/>Spirit, that the Saviour of Souls ſhould prepare Remedies, not for his Friends that fight on his ſide, but for Enemies and Souldiers that deſert him; that he ſhould admit them again to be new liſted under his Banner, is a Mercy beyond compariſon. To pardon Mutineers has been ſeen in Armies, but yet the Heads are commonly puniſhed, and the Companies disbanded; but not only to pardon ſuch Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Traytors, but to call them back, to Love, to Cure, to Reward, to Honour, and Suſtain them with his own Fleſh and Blood, can be the effect of nothing but an Infinite Charity and Compaſſion. So great is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Repentance, which giving us a Title to the blood of Chriſt, not only Cures thoſe that are wounded, but alſo raiſes thoſe that are dead in ſins; nor is there any thing above the Cure of that Soveraign Medicine, unleſs the Party affected reſiſts the power of it, which is ſo great, that it not only cures the Wound, but takes away the very Scars, and makes thoſe, that are recovered, more ſound and healthful than they were before.</p>
                     <p>Behold a Man fallen from a Ship into the Sea, and ready to be drowned amidſt the Waves! ſee with what eagerneſs he calls for a Cable, with what greedineſs he catches at the Plank, nay, the poor wretch would even lay hold on a naked Sword to ſave his Life, though with the loſs of his Blood; ſo the Chriſtian, who by the Grace of Baptiſm ſails in the Ship of the Church, being carried by<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98258:88"/>his Paſſions throws himſelf into the World, and is ſinking in the Tempeſt of his ſins, and if he be drowned, he periſhes to Eternity; but as he is ſinking, he finds this ſecond Plank of Repentance to ſave him from Shipwrack, and by it is drawn up into the Ship again, and preſerved to arrive in ſafety at his deſired Port. Apply thy ſelf therefore to the uſe of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, with Humility, with an holy Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and great ſorrow for thy ſins, and by Faith in the Merits of Chriſt's Blood, and then thou ſhalt riſe up not only cured, but crowned. Call to remembrance thy ſins, and make a firm Reſolution never to offend thy Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Be affected with a ſorrow, that is pure in its ſincerity, pious in its intention, great in its degree, perpetual in its laſting, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the enumeration of thy ſeveral ſins, with all the aggravating Circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Finally, let thy Confeſſion be clear and undiſſembled, with confuſion of Face for thy often relapſes, giving Glory to God, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Shame to thy ſelf,. Make uſe of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guide in all difficulties of Conſcience for thy Inſtruction and Conſolation. Forgive all Injuries thou haſt at any time received, which are but a few Pence in compariſon of the many Talents, which thou haſt to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and remember that Chriſt ſays,
<hi>Except ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> And not only forgive thine Enemies, but embrace them with unfeigned Affection, for his ſake, and by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98258:89"/>his Example, who loved thee, when thou waſt his Enemy.</p>

                     <p>In this Preparation of Soul wounded both with Love and Grief, and thirſting, as the Hart for the Water-brooks, approach reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the Sacrament of thy Saviour's Body and Blood, which that gracious Lord inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at his laſt Supper, for a continual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Croſs, purchaſing our Redemption by his Death, the Merits and Benefits whereof ſhall therein be aſſur'd and convey'd to thee, as a Pledge and Seal of thy Pardon. Apply it to thy ſelf with an humble Confidence in his Promiſes, with a firm Faith, that his Blood was ſhed for thee, ſince thou art admitted to be a partaker thereof. That Divine Antidote is not only to be thy Medicine, but thy Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and receiving it with lowlineſs and Devotion, thou ſhalt not only find Grace, but the Author of Grace; thou ſhalt not only find the Guide, but the Way, the Comfort, and Support of the Spirtual Life. If he be God Eternal, the Son of the Eternal Father whom thou receiveſt into thy Breaſt, art not thou certain, that all his Vertues and Attributes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him? If in receiving him I make him not only my Gueſt, but alſo my Lord and Ruler, I become one with him, as the fire which heats the Iron, is united with it. If his<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98258:89"/>Goodneſs be in me when I receive him, how is it, that it does not aboliſh my Wickedneſs? If his Omnipotency, why does it not take away my Weakneſs? If his Love be in me, why does it not expel my Luke-warmneſs? If his Purity and Chaſtity, why don't they chaſe away all my Defilements?</p>

What hinders me from hearing the wholſome Counſels of my moſt wiſe Inſtructor, or, if I hear them, from following them, but that my Paſſions make me deaf to his Inſpirations, or weak and unable to follow thoſe which I have heard? O Lord my God, and my Redeemer, All my Sickneſs is in my ſelf, all my Cure is in thee. O my God, ſince thou doſt vouchſafe to enter into me, ſtay there and deliver me from my ſelf: I am mine own Enemy, no body can hurt me, if I hurt not my ſelf. Free me from that inward Enemy, O dear and potent Friend; Thou art the ſtrength of Heaven, Thou art the ſuccour of the Weak, and I am weak; Thou art the light of the Blind, and I am blind; Thou art the comfort of the Afflicted, and I am afflicted; Thou art the Shepherd of loſt Sheep, and I am one of them; Thou art the pardoner of the Ungrateful, and I am even Ingratitude itſelf. What can Cure ſo great an Ignorance, but thy Heavenly Wiſdom? What can take away or deſtroy ſo great a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but thine Infinite Charity?

For to whom thou gaveſt Grace in the one, thou alſo gaveſt Health in the other. Art thou leſs able in my Soul, than thou wert in</hi> Judaea
<hi>and</hi> Paleſtine? <hi>Is not thy Power as great to Cure Souls now, as it was to Cure Bodies then, ſince thou didſt therefore Cure their Bodies, that thou mighteſt the better Cure their Souls? Is thy skill leſs now adays, O Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Phyſician, than it was in thoſe times? Does not thy Immenſe Charity rather increaſe, if it be poſſible for it to receive any augmentation? Does not every one of thy Benefits call a great many more after it? Canſt thou do any thing elſe, than give more, and more, and more? Art not thou All-powerful, O my Jeſus? Art not thou all Love and Goodneſs? And art not thou infinitely Wiſe? If then thou art both able, knowing, and willing; How is it, that I feel not the effects of thy Power, Goodneſs, and Wiſdom? It is true, I have very often reſiſted them all, but now I penitently yield my ſelf up to them; now I humbly proſtrate my ſelf, I call, I ſeek, and adore the Author of my Remedy. Enter into me, O Lord, my Glory. Caſt out of me all Humane Reſiſtance, and though (wretch that I am) I did reſiſt thy Vertues, I will no longer reſist thy Remedies. I deſire, O my God, to deſire.

I would fain deſire, but I know not how to deſire; I would fain work, but I know not how to work; but ſince thou entrest into me, O my Jeſus, work thou in me. Separate from me, and deſtroy in me all that hinders and detains me from ſerving, from loving, from following, and adoring thee. Let that Love of thine, which was enflamed with the love of me, conquer and expel this ungrateful want of love. Let thy Light drive away my Darkneſs, and thy Goodneſs my Wickedneſs. Finally, O Lord, make thy ſelf Maſter of me, of my heart, of my will, and of all my Faculties, and carry my Soul thy Captive in the Triumph of thine Infinite Love.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe are the breathings thou oughteſt to ſend forth from the bottom of thy Soul, when thou haſt receiv'd thy Lord, for that is the time for thee to beg and pray, ſince he is not deaf, but will hear thee; not dumb, but will ſpeak unto thee; not blind, but will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; and being moſt loving, he will not reject thy love. God works in the hearts of the Faithful according to what he himſelf is, and according to what he finds in them, and<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98258:91"/>even though he find not in them ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſpoſition as is due to ſo high a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; yet if they be in any meaſure diſpoſed, his goodneſs improves it, and even that firſt diſpoſition is a gift of his Goodneſs and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Since therefore he gives thee all things, and thou oweſt him whatſoever thou haſt, give thy ſelf wholly to him, who gives thee all things. Come with cleanneſs to receive that Divine Purity, and beg of him more Purity, and more cleanneſs, knowing thine own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement and unworthineſs. Keep him faſt with love, whom thou receiveſt with an holy reverential fear, and be not guilty of ſo groſs a folly, as to forſake him, when thou haſt but newly received him. For thee to receive God, and preſently to turn thy back upon him, and give thy ſelf up to Worldly Affairs, is the groſs ſtupidity of the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> who had ſcarce received him, when he preſently went away to ſell him. No, be not ſo baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, remain with him, and ſuffer thy ſelf to be enflamed with that Coeleſtial fire. To him reduce all thy love and conſideration, raiſe up thy mind to him in Heaven, and where thy Treaſure is, there let thine Heart be alſo.</p>

                  <head>The Third WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of frequenting the Sacrament.</head>
                  <p>THE time ſhall come (ſaith our Saviour to the Woman of
<hi>Samaria</hi>) that God ſhall be adored in all places, and not only in
<hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the time ſhall come when Heaven ſhall come upon Earth. Wouldſt thou attain eternal Bleſſings? Ask them of the Lord in the bleſſed Sacrament. Wouldſt thou be freed of thy Paſſions, and have all Vertues planted in thee? Wouldſt thou have encreaſe of Grace, and high Gifts of the Spirit? Beg them of the Lord in his Sacrament, receive it with frequency, and purify thy ſelf to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that Lord of all Purity. Receive with profound Humility that admirable Example of Humility; and with ardent Charity him, that is not only the Pattern of perfect Charity, but even Charity it ſelf. That which thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, he gives thee, and that which thou ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſireſt, and laboureſt for, thou mayeſt find in that foundation of all our Good, and that remedy of all our Evils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:98258:92"/>But thou wilt ſay, Alas! I cannot eaſily, no nor with all the Pains I take, find that Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Purity and Charity you ſpeak of, and which, you ſay, will make me fit to receive him; for if I could, I would ſeek them, and ſtrive to get them, and would offer them up to that Divine Lord; but becauſe I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, I fear to partake of that coeleſtial Food.</p>
                  <p>It concerns our Neceſſity to ſeek them, but the finding of them belongs to his Grace. If thou ſeekeſt them heartily in Spirit and Truth, thou already haſt them; for God in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs never obliges thee to find, but only to ſeek. The finding is much more certain than the ſeeking, for this depends upon thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but that upon his infinite Love and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou confeſs thy Sins with an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sorrow, and with true purpoſe and deſire of Amendment? Doſt thou avoid the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sin, and doſt thou fly from Evil, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to exerciſe thy ſelf in that which is good? Doſt thou feel Contrition for having offended ſo good a God? Art thou truly deſirous to pleaſe him for the future? Wouldſt thou in good earneſt have thy Soul and Conſcience or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him, and that he ſhould frame it according to his good pleaſure? Then what art thou afraid of? Draw near to thy Lord with Love, but yet ſtill preſerve his filial and holy Fear. That good fear does not ſeparate<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98258:93"/>a Man from God, but calls him and draws him nearer, and encreaſes in the Saints in the ſame Proportion that their Love does. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fear, which ſprings from the high Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſo high a Majeſty, and brings forth a deep Humility and Reverence of God, does not drive Souls from, but unites them more nearly to God. This is the difference between a baſe ſervile Fear, and a filial Fear; that the ſervile grows greater by doing ill; but filial Fear increaſes, and becomes more perfect by doing well. Wouldſt thou ſee it? An imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man fears by reaſon of the Pains of Hell. How much the more he ſins, ſo much the more he fears; and how much greater is the number of his Offences, ſo much greater is his fear of Damnation, nor does he make one ſtep in wickedneſs, which (if he ſet himſelf to think of it) does not augment that terror. This is the greateſt Anguiſh of Mind ill Men have when they come to die, and their fear is ſometimes ſo exceſſive, that they utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Mercy, unleſs God by his eſpecial Grace detain them. On the other ſide the good Man fears God, becauſe he is his Father, his Lord, and Creator, and is therefore afraid to diſpleaſe him; by how much the more he loves him, by ſo much the more he fears to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and anger him; and by how much the more his knowledge of that high Majeſty does encreaſe, by ſo much the more that holy Fear of God encreaſes alſo, and with it the<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98258:93"/>deſire of pleaſing him, and the care not to offend him, whereby he comes with greater confidence to rely upon his Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and therefore <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſays, <hi>That the holy Fear of God may conſiſt with the Bleſſedneſs of thoſe in Heaven, who, though they be already freed from the Fears of the World, and from loſing that unſpeakable Happineſs, do yet fear the Lord, as well as love him, and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear him, becauſe they love him; for this holy fear takes Birth from Love, is cloathed with Love, and is indeed rather reſpect and reverence, than fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus thou oughteſt to receive the Lord in the Sacrament with Love and with Fear, ſince this fear is Humility, is Reverence, is Love. For becauſe thou knoweſt ſo great a Majeſty, thou feareſt it; and fearing, loving, and reverencing the Greatneſs of that Majeſty thou art to approach, thou humbleſt thy ſelf in the depth of thine own unworthineſs; and this Knowledge, Fear, Reverence, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, inclines God to come unto thee, to dwell with thee, to inflame thee, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee in his Love. Woe be to that Man, that comes to receive Chriſt without fearing him! Woe be to that Man that receives, without conſidering that it is God, whom he receives, and that he that receives him is but a weak, wretched, and ſinful Man! Woe be to him, that receives God raſhly and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately without weighing the infinite Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <pb n="162" facs="tcp:98258:94"/>that there is between the high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od, and ſo vile a Creature!</p>
                  <p>Thoſe holy Men, who did moſt frequently receive and conſecrate the Sacrament, were they, that fear'd him moſt, and within that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Reverence, and Fear they found the Treaſures of Love. O what tears of Fear did they ſhed at the receiving of it! What fire of Love did they find in their Breaſts by being ſo united to their Saviour? What high know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſprang up from the depth of their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Fear? What Faith in believing and adoring him? What Hope in ſeeking him, and what Charity in finding and poſſeſſing him? They did, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, at the firſt knowledge of his Maſter's Divinity in the Miracle of the draught of Fiſhes, when throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf proſtrate at his feet, he ſaid, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, O L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rd, for I am a ſinful Man.</hi> The Apoſtle runs to his Maſter's feet, and at the ſame time prays him to depart from him. His high fear makes him beg that he would depart, and his ardent Love makes him at the ſame inſtant to draw near; that approach was cauſed by Love, and the bidding him depart proceeded from fear. Thus at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be thou all Humility, Fear, and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that thou art unworthy to receive ſo great a Lord, but yet knowing thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, thou oughteſt ſo much the rather to approach ſo high a Majeſty with Love as well as with Fear and Humility. That Fear, which ſeparates us from God, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98258:94"/>a good Fear; for where but in God can we find the Perfection both of Love and Fear?</p>
                  <p>O eternal God, is not thy Goodneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable? Art not thou a God, who giveſt thy ſelf, and makeſt all Creatures to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of thy Goodneſs? Then why ſhall not we come to this Communion, and receive this communicable Good? Art not thou Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Liberality it ſelf, who beſtoweſt thy Treaſures upon all? Didſt thou inſtitute this Sacrament in Bread and Wine, to the end that Men ſhould only ſee it, and not receive and eat it? Why didſt thou leave thy ſelf in this manner amongſt Men, but to be their Support and Nouriſhment? When thou didſt conſecrate this Coeleſtial Bread, didſt thou not receive it firſt of all thy ſelf, and then give it unto thy Holy Diſciples? Thou kneweſt, O Lord, their Imperfections, and that they would forſake thee and deny thee that very night; yet thou gaveſt them remedy in thy bleſſed Body, for without that their fall and their loſs had been much greater.</p>
                  <p>O eternal Glory, doſt thou ſeek me, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll not I receive thee? Doſt thou come from Heaven to ſeek me, and ſhall I fly out of the Church that I may not receive thee? Thou comeſt, O eternal Shepherd, to be both my Shepherd and my Food, and ſhall I poor, loſt, and wandring Sheep refuſe this Food, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be born upon thoſe bleſſed Shoulders? Didſt thou ſhed thy Blood, to give it me for<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98258:95"/>drink, and was thy Body broken, that I might feed upon it; and ſhall I ſhut my Lips, and my Heart, and Soul, againſt this meat and againſt this drink? If I reject thee, who art the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of all my Griefs, whom ſhall I ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? If I drink not of thee, thou Fountain of all Goodneſs, when ſhall my thirſt be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? If I bath not in this Fountain, which thou haſt ſet open for Sin and for Uncleanneſs, who ſhall waſh this Soul full of ſo many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Pollutions? And if I be not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, my God, my Lord, and my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but when I am indeed worthily diſpoſed for it, when ſhall I ever dare to approach thy Table? Is any the higheſt <hi>Cherubim</hi> or

Is there any Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs worthy or capable of that infinite Majeſty? The Bleſſed Virgin thy Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes ſhe is not worthy to receive thee, and what am I then polluted Wretch, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, unworthy beyond all unworthineſs? Didſt thou not know, O eternal God, when thou didſt inſtitute this Sacrament, that it was to be received by weak Men, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinners? Thou didſt conſecrate it with this Condition, O infinite Mercy, that thou wert to ſuffer the Miſery of our Nature, and to bear with the Neglects and Imperfections of our Frailty. Before thou madeſt thy ſelf the Nouriſhment of Men, thou kneweſt the Weakneſs and Sinfulneſs of Men, and didſt<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98258:95"/>leave this Inſtitution not only for our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo for the remedy of our Diſeaſes. Who can cure them, O God, but thou? Who elſe can guide and ſtrengthen and encourage me to encounter all the Difficulties, to avoid all the Deceits, and to overcome all the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I meet with in this Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare? Who can be my Antidote againſt the Poiſon of Sin, but the Author of Grace? Who can enable me in this Baniſhment to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through the moſt rugged Paſſages into my heavenly Country, but thou, who art the Way, the Truth, and the Life, that doſt ſuſtain, lead, cheer, and refreſh me? Do not ſuffer me, O Lord, to have that kind of fear, which ſhall hinder me from ſerving and adoring thee, from ſeeking and finding thee, from poſſeſſing and enjoying thee; but give me a filial and reverential Fear, and ſuch an one, as even in the midſt of fear may enflame me with thy Love.</p>
                  <p>Thus may we comfort and encourage our ſelves againſt the thought, that Fear cannot well conſiſt with Love, by which miſtake ſome are kept from daring to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>That perfect Love caſts out Fear,</hi> they believe that Love and Fear are not compatible, and that not having this Love, it would be a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in them to receive the Communion of the Body and Blood of the Holy Jeſus. But they do not well underſtand St. <hi>John,</hi> for he does not ſpeak of reverential Fear, which<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98258:96"/>is very conſiſtent with Love, and grows up with it; but of ſervile Fear, for that is it, which is thrown out by holy and perfect Love. The holy Fear of God keeps no Man from doing any thing that is good; and much leſs from the chiefeſt good, which is the receiving this bleſſed Sacrament: but rather by how much more perfect fear is, ſo much the more does it burn in Love, and ſo much the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does it draw us to God. And thou muſt not only take heed that filial fear hinder thee not from receiving it with that frequency, which thy Spiritual Guide ſhall adviſe; but thou oughteſt alſo not to forbear the receiving it, though with but a ſervile Fear. If thou haſt thy Conſcience burdened with no hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin, and haſt confeſſed and lamented all thoſe thou knoweſt thy ſelf guilty of, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to forſake them for the future; Go with Humility, and an holy Confidence to receive that Sacrament, for God may turn thy Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Contrition, and his Love will better thy fear; though in the beginning it be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, yet if thou frequent the Table of the Lord, his Grace will amend it, and make it to become Filial. It often happens, and very often, that beginning by the fear of Hell and Puniſhment, a Man comes at laſt to the fear of offending ſo great a Goodneſs; the Lord being ſo gracious and ſo good, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes our Charity, only through the exceſs of his. We begin with that which is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, before we can attain to that, which is<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98258:96"/>perfect. We begin with Self-love, and end with the hatred of our ſelves, and with the perfect Love of God. Believe me, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Sacrament draws vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages along with it, and thoſe the Lord only by his infinite Goodneſs works wonderfully in us, beyond what we ſee, know, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Let every one draw near with ſuch Examination, Confeſſion, and Preparation, as he is able to make, be it more or leſs, (if he have us'd his utmoſt diligence) and let him hope that God will give him an hundred-fold encreaſe of what he brings. How many Saints hath ſervile Fear made, and brought to filial Fear, who afterwards with Faith and Hope, burning in Charity, have caſt away the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fear, and been enflam'd with love of the ſecond? How many Saints have begun their Spiritual courſe with fear of being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Hell, who afterwards only for God, and his Love's ſake, have repented and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Sins, and are now reigning in the Joys of Heaven? How many Saints have by the means of Love caſt out that imperfect Fear, which was the Inſtrument to bring them to Love, and to perfect filial Fear? Our good Lord cures and remedies all things; if we ſeek him, and receive him by Grace, truſting and relying upon his Goodneſs, and Love to us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe acts of Religion, which are due as to their laſt end, unto the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons in one Eſſence, thou oughteſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to direct to the Reverence and the<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98258:97"/>Worſhip of God in this divine and myſterious Sacrament. In this Point all the Lines of thy Affection and Devotion ought to meet, as in their Center. Though it was the Son alone, by whom it was inſtituted, yet the Father is with him, and with the Father is the Holy Ghoſt. That Divine Lord, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Saviour, took our Nature upon him, being conceived in the Womb of the bleſſed Virgin; and if thou doſt adore him, the Saints and Angels are at the ſame time Adoring and Worſhipping him, whom thou doſt adore and worſhip; and for thy doing ſo with them, He will both help and bleſs thee. Thus the Devotion to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament is the greateſt of all Devotions. This Worſhip and Reverence is the higheſt, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the reſt.</p>

                     <head>Of the Kingdom of Grace.</head>
                     <p>THE Kingdom of God, ſays the Saviour of Souls, is within you, and it is that Kingdom of Grace, which brings to the eternal Kingdom of Glory, nor is it a ſmall benefit and comfort that it is within us, that we need not go far to ſeek it, and to find it. Happy is that neceſſitous Perſon, who has his relief within himſelf, he cannot be poor, unleſs through perverſe idleneſs he embraces his own Miſery, neither deſiring, nor knowing how to make uſe of that relief. O the great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, that we ſhould have this holy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within us, and yet go out of it? O the high Misfortune, that this Kingdom of Grace being an infallible Pledge of that eternal one of Glory, I by my Sins ſhould baniſh my ſelf from both the Kingdom of Grace, and that of Glory that I my ſelf, of my own accord ſhould forſake the eternal Joys, and chooſe the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, by embracing Paſſions and deſpiſing Vertue!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:98258:98"/>The Kingdom of Grace, is to be in the Grace of God, and God in us by his Mercy; to ſubdue our Paſſions, and by that means to make the inſide ſuitable to the outſide; It is, that my Reaſon ſhould govern my Paſſions, and the Spirit my Reaſon, and to keep the Fleſh mortified under that Dominion. The Kingdom of Grace is that mine own Will and Appetites ſhould be deſtroyed, as much as may be, and that the Divine Will ſhould rule Inſtead of it. O true Kingdom! O juſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, without the leaſt ſhew of Tyranny, where the Creator governs the Creature, and where Reaſon keeps the Paſſions, and inferior. Faculties of the Soul in ſubjection to it! O Kingdom of true and holy Peace, which knows nothing but Quietneſs and inward Joy above all other Contentments!</p>
                     <p>The Kingdom of Grace is for God to be in the Soul, and the Soul in God; for the Son to be in the Favour of his Father; for the Creature to find himſelf beloved by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for the Servant to yield himſelf humble, obedient, and reſigned to the Will of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lord, which is not only Grace, but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and great Glory. In how great liberty is that happy Soul, that lives and acts thus in the Grace of God! how much above all the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Miſeries of this Life! No torment, no pain, no diſguſt cometh into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for there can be no torment, pain or diſguſt but in the loſs of it; nor can any one loſe it, but he that will, by forſaking Grace,<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98258:98"/>to commit Sin. So long as a Man is in the Grace of God, and does not loſe his Grace and Mercy, all things elſe do neither add to him, nor take from him, neither hurt him, nor concern him. Let the World burn in Wars, abound in Misfortunes or ſhine in Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; Let this Man riſe, and the other fall; Let humane Affairs go as they will, and theſe temporal tranſitory Kingdoms be in Peace or in Confuſion. He from the height of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom looks down upon all with a quiet Reſignation. Let all the World join a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and with the World, the Fleſh and the Devil. Let Affronts, Calumnies, and Perſecutions ariſe; if he loſe not God, and his Grace, all the reſt is but a greater encreaſe of Grace, and a nearer approach to Glory. Strive therefore to enter into this Kingdom, for only thoſe that live in it here, ſhall ſee the Face of God hereafter. Rather live tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in it, than be drawn out of it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Pleaſures. Rather ſuffer thy ſelf to be torn in pieces, than to be brought under the Slavery and Miſeries of Sin. Rather ſuffer a thouſand Torments in this holy militant <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> than make thy ſelf a wretched Slave in the infamous City <hi>Babylon.</hi> Forſake not thoſe Squadrons that are at the Gates of Heaven, to flie over to thoſe, that are entring into the Jaws of Hell. Each of theſe muſt go to their own place, either to Glory, or eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That they might not forſake this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, the Holy Apoſtles, Martyrs, and<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98258:99"/>Confeſſors forſook their Lives; not to loſe that, the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> loſt his Head, St. <hi>Peter</hi> choſe his Croſs, and the Apoſtle of the Gentiles gave up his Neck to the Sword, St.
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> gave his very Skin, and finally all the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven choſe Tribulations and Torments here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, rather than to leave that ſweet Kingdom of Grace. And what great matter was it, that they loſt here, ſince they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it an hundred fold in the Kingdom of Glory? O happy Torments! O joyful Death, that is rewarded with eternal Bliſs! This Knowledge, and theſe Lights will God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in thee, if thou liveſt humbly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and reſigned, diſpoſing thy ſelf daily to receive more Grace.</p>

                     <head>Of the Purity of Intentions.</head>
                     <p>O that I could ſee my ſelf ſo ſecure in this Kingdom of Grace, as never to enter into that ſad and diſmal Kingdom of Sin! But how can I be ſecure, ſo long as I live in this miſerable Life ſo full of Snares and Dangers? There can be no ſecurity, where Man's Will is to act, which is ſo weak and frail, and ſo unſteady. The World is full of Snares, there are more Stumbling-blocks, than Steps. We carry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us the Nouriſhment of our own Miſeries, and the Source of our Paſſions is the cauſe of our Sins and Imperfections. But for all that, Wouldſt thou perſevere in this Kingdom of Grace, and go with full ſail into the Kingdom
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98258:99"/>of Glory? Watch then, and pray, hope and fear, truſt and perſiſt. Let thine Intentions be pure, and thy Conſcience clean, and do all things as in the Preſence of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the end of this ſhort Voyage will be the Haven of the Coeleſtial Country, and of eternal Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Let thine Intentions be pure, (I repeat it again to thee) let thine Intentions be pure, for thereby thy Paſſage ſhall be ſafe from Rocks and Tempeſts. If thy Intention really be to ſerve God, and to pleaſe him in all things; thy Practice, thy Words, thy Actions will alſo be to pleaſe him in all things. As Matters go with thee internally, ſo will they alſo externally. If the Tree be good, it gives good Fruit, and if evil, evil Fruit. An evil Tree cannot bring forth that which is good, nor the good that which is evil. The Quality of the Spiritual Tree is taken from that of the Intentions, and the Quality of Fruits and Works from that of the Tree. O happy he, who has a clean and pure Heart, that is, a clean and pure Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! O happy he, who deſires and loves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, and his Service! for all the Exerciſes of ſuch a Man will be to ſerve and adore him.</p>
                     <p>Thus then if thou deſireſt to perſevere and to encreaſe in the Spiritual Life, let thy firſt rule be to purifie thy Intention, for that gives Life to thy Works, and Cleanneſs to thy Heart.
<hi>If thine Eye be ſingle,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>all thy Body</hi>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98258:100"/>
                        <hi>will be full of Light, as if he had ſaid,</hi> if the Intention be right, the Body of all the Actions will be right, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in good Example. The Light, that lightens thy Body, is thine Intention; if it be pure, it enlightens thee; if otherwiſe, thou wilt walk in darkneſs. See! how a Lanthorn ſhines that has a little Candle in it, it not only is clear it ſelf, but gives light to all that are round about it: So the Soul, that has a pure holy Intention within it, has thereby all its Actions made holy, clear, and perfect. God is to be thy Intention in all thou doſt, in all thou ſpeakeſt, in all thou thinkeſt, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou doſt, muſt be for God, with God, and through God.</p>

                     <head>Of Purity of Conſcience.</head>
                     <p>If this be thy Intention, and thou haſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its Purity, thou ſhalt eaſily by the Grace of God attain Purity of Conſcience alſo, or rather it may be ſaid, if thou haſt the one, thou already haſt the other alſo, for what is Purity of Conſcience, but Purity of Heart and Intention? If that be pure, thy Thoughts, Words, and Actions, will be ſo likewiſe; and if they be pure, thy Heart and Conſcience are ſo too; yet Purity of Conſcience ſignifies, not to conſent to any blemiſh or defect in thee, and when thou findeſt any to throw it away preſently, and to waſh it with tears; It ſignifies an attentive Care and Vigilance to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98258:100"/>purifie the Soul from all Sins and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſmall as well as great, and not to allow them entrance, or let them remain there, but to confeſs, bewail, and forſake them; It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies an implacable Enmity between Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Truth, and Sincerity of Heart, and Sins of all kinds, and a diſſent and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them without permitting them to make any ſtay in it. It ſignifies an exact care to ſee and obſerve what paſſes in thy Soul, and not to tolerate any thing in it, not only that is contrary, but that tends but to the leſſening thy deſires to pleaſe God; It ſignifies a great diſquiet and uneaſineſs at any thing that offends God, and an open War againſt Sins without having any Contentment or Satisfaction, till thou haſt thrown them out by Penitence and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that live and walk with this hateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with this deſire are they, which the Saviour of Souls meant, when he ſaid,
<hi>Bleſſed are the pure, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> as if he had ſaid, 'tis impoſſible to ſee God without purity of Heart. Let a Man do works that are never ſo perfect and holy, let him be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in Alms, viſit Hoſpitals, pray, and ſuffer as much as he will, or do any thing elſe; If his Heart and Conſcience be not pure, 'tis impoſſible for him to ſee or enjoy God, till he have cleanſed and purified them. Into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no defect can enter, nothing but what is clear, ſhall be received into that bright City, for a Man muſt enter there, as he is to<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98258:101"/>live there. No Man can ſee God in Glory, even though he were in Glory, unleſs his ſight be made ſo clear by purity of Life, as to be able by the Divine goodneſs to be raiſed to behold God. Employ therefore all thy care to cleanſe thy Heart and Conſcience; not to conſent, that any Sins, Paſſions, or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſhould lodge there, but to throw them out, and waſh them off with tears. I do not ſay that thou ſhouldſt have none, (though I wiſh it) but that thou ſhouldſt not entertain them, for it is impoſſible in this ſinful Life, that a Man ſhould not fall into ſmall, and ſometimes even into great Sins; but whether they be great or ſmall, he ought to deteſt them, as ſoon as they are perceived, and not to keep but to caſt them out inſtantly with humble Sorrow. Do not go to ſleep with Sin in thine Heart, before thou haſt waſhed it out with tears. Think how unſafe it would be for a Man to ſleep with a Viper in his Boſom, but 'tis far more dangerous to ſleep with Sin in the Soul. As the Sea caſts out dead Bodies, ſo do thou caſt Sins out of thy Soul. See how long thou canſt keep a burning Coal in the Palm of thine Hand, and even a leſs time ſuffer Sin to continue in thy Soul. As in the other Life no Man can ſee God without a pure Heart; ſo in this Spiritual Life ſeldom does a Man hearken to God, till he hath cleanſed his Conſcience by caſting out his Sins. Sins and Paſſions are troubleſome Companions, and make ſo great a noiſe, that they diſquiet and<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98258:101"/>deafen the inward Senſes. In the loud noiſe of a Mill. I could not well hear the gentle voice of a Friend, who comes to ſuccour me in imminent danger; It is neceſſary the noiſe ſhould ceaſe, that I may apply my attention to hear the voice of my Friend: If my Soul be diverted with Paſſions and other Thoughts, how can it hear the amorous Invitations of the eternal Word? How can his holy Inſpirations enter, or work upon me, if I be taken up and carried away with worldly Cares? If the Light of my Reaſon, and of the Spirit be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by my Paſſions, how ſhall I ſee God, or hear him, when he ſpeaks in my Heart? Thy Life is within thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Government of it ought to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Spiritual. Thou oughteſt to obſerve thy inward Motions, and to hearken to the ſecret Voice of thy Maſter and Redeemer, who comes to direct thee. His Precepts and divine Counſels are not only to guide thee outwardly, but by them thou art to ſquare all thy Thoughts, Words and Actions. It is not only from our Spiritual Fathers and Teachers, that we ought to receive direction, but we have alſo another Maſter, an inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Maſter, which is the Spirit of God, who is Superior to them and enlightens them. That ſhall ſpeak to thee, admoniſh, and reprehend, and guide thee, and thou art to hearken to, and obey it, which thou wilt neither be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor able to do, if thy Conſcience be not pure, and if thou doſt not liſten attentively<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98258:102"/>to it. That holy Maſter will govern thee with internal Light and Knowledge, to which it is a great hindrance, if the Heart be drawn away by Sin, whether great or ſmall, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by Self-love, and a Fondneſs of the Vanities of the World.</p>
                     <p>Pray therefore to God, that he would cleanſe thy Heart, awaken, enlighten, guide, and teach thee, and not ſuffer Sins or Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to enter into thy Soul, or if at any time through infirmity thou falleſt into any, that he would give thee Grace to bewail them, and to return to purity of Heart.</p>

                     <p>BUT methinks I hear thee complaining, and ſaying, Lord, I deſire to pleaſe thee, and would fain keep faſt in this Kingdom of Grace, that I may not looſe that high King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, nor be ungrateful for ſo great benefits; but my weakneſs is very frail, and temptations are many, which croſs and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my works and my deſires. In me every ſtep is a danger, or, to ſpeak more properly a loſs. The Fleſh diſturbs me, the Devil afrights me, and the World deceives me. I feel a Law within me, which drags me away, and carries me after it, and when I have a mind to that which is good, I find my ſelf a Captive to that which is evil; and though I know what is beſt, yet I am drawn to follow that which is worſt. I would flie even from my ſelf, and yet I ſtill find ſelf within me. O wretched Man! Who ſhall deliver me from that ſelf, which hath more power over me, than I my ſelf have.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:98258:103"/>Do not diſturb thy ſelf, thou haſt one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, who will defend thee from thy ſelf; great is the Labour, but greater the Aſſiſtance. If the Devil perſecutes thee, God helps thee. If the Fleſh tempts thee, the Spirit encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth thee; and if the World entices thee, the divine Light guides thee. Suffer with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, and be not weary of ſuffering, for from thence will come thy remedy and thy reward. Fear not Temptations when they come to thee, but fear them, when thou goeſt to them. If God permits them to come, he will ſtrengthen thee to reſiſt them, and aſſiſt thee to conquer them; But take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Temptation by thine own will and choice, for then thou wilt fall in it. By how many ſteps thou goeſt towards danger, by ſo many thou draweſt nearer to Sin. Believe me I give thee Caution. Thou art not ſo ſtrong as <hi>David,</hi> nor ſo wiſe as his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> and yet both of them fell by going to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. If thou liveſt with warineſs, heed, and fear, be not afraid of thoſe Temptations, wherewith the Lord proves thee, for he does it to ſee the Bottom of thy Vertue. If with the Left-hand he tempts, with the Right he helps thee; If with the one he aſſails thee, with the other he ſupports thee. Wouldſt thou triumph without getting the Victory? No Man is crown'd in Peace, but he that with Valour, Conſtancy and Perſeverance endures the Hardſhips of War. Wouldſt thou live in the Spiritual Life without Temptations and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98258:103"/>Tribulations? That is not to be truly Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Take it therefore for a Temptation to be without temptation. The ſtilleſt Peace uſes to be the higheſt danger, and what ſeems to be ſafety, is many times but deceit and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Devil lets thee alone to make thee truſt in thine own ſelf, that he may the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the more certainly deſtroy thee. That troubleſome Enemy has his Stratagems, he withdraws to deceive thee, and retires to come back with a freſh Aſſault. Sometimes he recreates thy Senſes, diſpoſes thee to Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and outward Devotion, only to beget a ſecret Pride in thee, and a fooliſh Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that may carry thee to eternal ruine. But do not thou conſent to that, which is bad, but ask Strength of God, and ſo thou wilt make the Bad to become Good. The Saints ſuffered Tribulation, and the Saviour of the World ſuffered Temptation, and doſt thou refuſe to ſuffer them? By going the ſame way thou ſhalt come to the ſame end, and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thou ſhalt attain. Do not believe, that without ſteering the ſame courſe, thou ſhalt arrive at the ſame Port, where they are entred. Doſt thou think to find a particular way for thy ſelf? That will be no way, but a Precipice. Sufferings, Pains, Difficulties, and the Croſs are the way to Heaven, but in thoſe Pains and Difficulties there is exceeding great Conſolation. Who art thou, that thou wouldſt not ſuffer, weak, wretched, and faint-hearted Sinner? Who art thou? or what Man is there<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98258:104"/>in the World, that can be exempt from Troubles and Temptations? Man is born to Labour, and is full of Miſery, within him and without him, he is encompaſs'd round therewith; but fear not Tribulations or Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, be afraid of nothing but Sin. Believe me, there is no other way to ſave thee, but the royal, holy, and perfect way of the Croſs. The Redeemer of Souls ſaves us by the Croſs, He died upon the Croſs, and we muſt live under the Croſs, to enjoy the Triumphs of the Croſs. He from his Paſſion came to his Reſurrection, and by his Reſurrection to his glorious Aſcenſion. Thou ſhalt never be rais'd to the Life eternal, if thou doſt not ſuffer for God in this temporal Life. Thou ſhalt not enter into the Kingdom of Glory, without ſtriving here in the Kingdom of Grace. Doſt thou think, that by avoiding to ſuffer for God, thou ſhalt eſcape ſuffering? Thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, for they ſuffer moſt, that run fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from God. O how much greater are the Sufferings of thoſe, that are ſo deceivd! how much more painful and afflicting! The Sinner paſſeth his whole Life in pains by reaſon of his Vices; and ſo much the greater are his Torments, by how much the greater are thoſe Paſſions, which diſquiet and moleſt his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Mind. Behold the loathſome Diſeaſes of the ſenſual Man, both of his Body and Soul! Behold the unclean Surfeits of the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton! Behold the fiery Rage of the Angry and Revengeful! The racking Cares of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous!
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98258:104"/>and the uneaſie Emulations of the Proud! Behold the frettings of the Envious Man! All of them live, or rather all of them die, for how can they be ſaid to live, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch Anguiſh and Vexation? Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the difference between him that ſuffers for God outwardly, and feels joy and comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And how wilt thou grow in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life without Temptations and Tribulations? Thou canſt not only not grow, nor thrive, but not ſo much as live in it. Wouldſt thou drive Sin out of thy Heart? It muſt be by Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe it will ſtill remain there. Wouldſt thou drive away thy Paſſions? It muſt be by conquering Temptations. Wouldſt thou be fitted for the Coeleſtial Building? It muſt be by the Chiſel and Mallet of Temptation and Mortification. Wouldſt thou throw out Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Habits? It muſt be by exerciſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Vertues. Wouldſt thou live humbled? It is neceſſary that thou ſhouldſt be afflicted. Wouldſt thou know what thou art? By ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temptations thou ſhalt perceive thine own Frailty and Miſery. Wouldſt thou caſt Self-love out of thine unquiet Heart? Deliver thy ſelf up to an holy Self-denial. Wouldſt thou give thy ſelf wholly to God, thy Saviour and Redeemer? Deny thy ſelf, and refuſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thine own deſires. Finally, wouldſt thou have Glory? Take up the Croſs, embrace Sufferings, love Tribulations, do not defend thy ſelf from the Croſs, but under the Croſs, and by the Croſs; do not defend thy ſelf from<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98258:105"/>Sufferings, but under them by the power of Grace; do not defend thy ſelf from the Temptations which God ſends thee, but from the evil of thoſe he ſends thee.</p>

                     <head>Of the Grace of God.</head>
                     <p>This indeed is a ſharp unpleaſing Doctrine, and very unwelcome to our Nature; but if it be an Enemy to our Nature, it is a Friend to our Spirit, and to that Grace, which brings Glory to our Nature. It is a ſafe Doctrine, becauſe it is taught by our Redeemer. It preſſes Men to take care of their Souls, that they may ſeek God, and not forſake him; that they may ſerve him, and not offend him. But all this which is ſo difficult, and even impoſſible to our frailty, is ſweet and eaſie by the Grace of God. It is that Grace, which fills and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, aſſiſts and conquers, convinces and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, does and perfects all. The moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Grace of God, is that, which ſweetens all Labours, and renders them not only tolerable, but delightful. This Grace makes the good deſire Sufferings, as the bad do Pleaſures, and cauſes them to find Joys in their Auſterities, when the wicked find Trouble in the midſt of<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98258:106"/>their Delights. Grace encourages, ſuſtains, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and gives an inward ſweetneſs to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which makes them more ſavoury and pleaſant, than the moſt pretended Enjoyments of this World. Grace in the Spiritual Life ſtrengthens the weak, enlightens the blind, eaſes the afflicted, comforts the ſorrowful, and gives joy to the diſconſolate. Grace ſupports the Soul, animates, guides, accompanies, raiſes it when it is ſinking, leads it in the way, and crowns it in the end. O moſt powerful Grace of God! thou admirable effect of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All is owing to thee; How many ſteps are taken in the Spiritual Life, how many affections and deſires are ſtirred up, how many good actions are done, how much perſeverance is exerciſed, how many tears are ſhed, and how much love is enkindled, all is owing to God's Holy Grace. Fear not therefore Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations if Grace be with thee, for by it Temptations and Tribulations will be rendred of no force, and thou ſhalt conquer all by its Effectual and Omnipotent Power. <hi>I can do all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>through him that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> for then he was ſtrengthened by Grace; <hi>Not I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but the Grace of God, which is in me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I work, but I am carried, guided, and aſſiſted by Grace, for without it I neither know, nor can do any thing, being of my ſelf unable ſo much as to think one good thought.</p>

<hi>David</hi> lamented his fall, by the help of Grace! Behold how quickly St.
<hi>Peter</hi> waſh'd away his ſin with tears by the help of Grace! Behold with what Reſolution <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> broke off the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs of her ſinful Life, by the help of Grace! Behold how ſuddenly St. <hi>Paul</hi> from a Perſecutor, became a joyful ſufferer of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Prodigy of the World, by the help of Grace! See the World converted and reformed, and Heaven peopled in a ſhort time by the Apoſtles, through the help of Grace! Now that ſame Grace, which made them Saints, may make thee one alſo, though now thou art a ſinner. 'Tis the ſame Grace that favours and aſſiſts thee, and is not leſs powerful now, but is as kind, as ſweet, as ſtrong, and effectual, as it was then. Grace does not grow old, but continues the ſame, or rather increaſes. Strive then, fight, and perſevere, for he that without Grace is but meer weakneſs, may by it become a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conquerour.</p>

                  <head>Of the Glory of the Bleſſed.</head>
                  <p>THough the former Doctrine was ſad and diſconſolate, I hope this laſt has chear'd and comforted thee. We muſt ſtill walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hope and fear; for the doubt of fear reſtrains us, and the light of hope ſets us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To facilitate the way of the Spirit is good and ſound Counſel, and of poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, for it is made eaſie by Grace, and therefore a Chriſtian ought not to be afraid of it; but to facilitate Salvation, and to make it conſiſtent with a looſe and licentious Life; to make it attainable without ſeeking Heaven in good earneſt, without Repentance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition through Grace, and without conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſions, and baniſhing them from the Soul; to make it eaſie, I ſay, to be ſav'd that way, is a moſt plain Fallacy, and dangerous Deceit. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and therefore the ſteps that lead to Glory are Tribulations. And believe me, even ſo it is purchaſed at a very cheap rate, for all we can ſuffer in this Life full of Miſeries, is not worthy of the Glory that ſhall be revealed,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98258:107"/>which he obtains, who ſuffers willingly for God. What can our Sufferings be in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe Enjoyments? How light are they all in reſpect of the eternal weight of Glory? What an inexpreſſible Happineſs muſt it be, to ſee ones ſelf admitted to be one of the Citizens of the Coeleſtial <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to ſee ones ſelf in the raviſhing Company of Saints and Angels; to ſee ones ſelf with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and Virgins; to ſee all thoſe Juſt and Holy Spirits ſinging Hymns and Praiſes to the Glory of God? And yet all this is leſs (though unſpeakably great) than to ſee the holy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Lord, that gracious Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thoſe Divine Eyes, whoſe brightneſs darkeneth the Sun, and enlightens all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; thoſe Hands and Feet, and that pierced Side, from whence, as Blood heretofore, there now comes forth the Splendour of Glory, the Stream of Grace, the Joy and Comfort of all the Saints. And ſtill this is leſs, than to ſee God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, Three Perſons in One Eſſence, the beginning and the end of all Creatures, (that ineffable Myſtery, which exceeds all created Underſtandings) before whom all the Angels and Saints proſtrate themſelves in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This is that, which amazes the Pen, and humbles the higheſt Meditations, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation whereof the moſt lofty Cherubims and Seraphims loſe themſelves, not being able fully to comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98258:108"/>From this Fountain and Original of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Goodneſs proceed all the Felicities of thoſe holy Citizens in that Triumphant <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> from that Source of Joy and Delights flow all their Delights and Pleaſures; from that Infinite, Omnipotent, and Supream Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which is Incomprehenſible in all it's Attributes, ſprings the Original Glory of the Bleſſed. All their Power and Being ariſes from his Power and Being. The ſight of that Goodneſs, that Wiſdom, and Charity is the cauſe of theirs. From that Light proceeds their Light. Only to ſee one of his Attributes, whether his Goodneſs, Juſtice, or Mercy, (though 'tis impoſſible to ſee any one of them without ſeeing the reſt) is enough to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Glory to all the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>What a bleſſedneſs alſo is it to turn the Eyes upon the Order and Beauty of that whole Coeleſtial Court? To ſee the Martyrs crown'd with Enſigns of their own Valour; to ſee the Holy Confeſſors adorn'd with their Vertues; to ſee the Virgins with their Palms and Crowns; only to ſee the Order wherein they are rank'd, and wherewith they Adore and Praiſe the Lord; to ſee the Nine Quires of Angels with the Three admirable Hierarchies; only to ſee the great number of beatified Souls and Spirits, every one in his Place and Employment ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Creator, and the Author of all their Happineſs with unſpeakable Contentment. What a wonderful and high Felicity is this? Then what Peace, what Contentment, what
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98258:108"/>Joy, what Quiet, what Sweetneſs, what U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, what Conformity, what Ardent love of God, and of his Creatures, is there in that bleſſed City?</p>
                  <p>Finally, wouldſt thou ſee what Heaven is? Look what all the Delights of this World are, freed from any mixture of Diſguſt, and thou ſhalt find, that in reſpect of them, they are but Pains and Torments. Think what it is to hear the ſweeteſt Voices, to ſmell the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfumes, and to enjoy whatever can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the reſt of the Senſes; think of an Heart full of Joy and Contentment, an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all the Powers of the Soul fill'd with all the Delights and Pleaſures, that this World can afford, it is all but Sadneſs and Affliction, Pain and Anguiſh in the higheſt degree in compariſon of thoſe Eternal Joys.</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know what Glory is? Then conſider, who it is, that gives it to the Saints. Think how Infinite the Power of God is, it's his Power that gives that Glory. Think how Infinite is his Wiſdom, 'tis that Wiſdom, which gives that Glory. Think how Infinite is his Goodneſs, 'tis that Goodneſs, which gives that Glory. If then an Infinite Power, an Infinite Wiſdom, and an Infinite Goodneſs joyn together to give Glory, what muſt that Glory be, which is the effect of ſuch a Power, of ſuch a Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of ſuch a Goodneſs? If God gives to every one of his Saints in his juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to his Love, his Power, and his Wiſdom, what Riches ſhall he give, who<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98258:109"/>is infinitely Rich? What Wiſdom and Light ſhall he give, who is Infinitely Wiſe? And what Joy ſhall he give, who is Infinitely Good and Happy? If the neceſſitous Perſon mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his hopes by the Power and Hand of the Liberal; what ſhall the Joy be, that is given by an Infinite Power, which is willing to give that which is Infinite?</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou ſee what Joys thoſe are, which God will give to the Bleſſed in Heaven? Think how great the Puniſhments are, that are inflicted upon the Damned in Hell. If thoſe are ſo ſharp and intolerable for the pain of them to the wicked, how ſweet and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant will be the Enjoyments of the good? Though his Juſtice and his Mercy are Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially equal, yet in the effects his Mercy is greater than his Juſtice; for he puniſhes in Hell leſs than Sinners deſerve, and rewards in Heaven more than the Saints deſerve. What Glory ſhall he give in Heaven, who puniſheth ſo terribly in Hell with everlaſting Fire?</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou ſee the Joys which he confers upon the Elect, who ſerve him in this Life? Think what he ſuffered for them, and what he did to ſave them. If he gave his Blood and Life upon the Croſs for the bad, as well as for the good; What will he give in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the good alone? And if he underwent ſo many pains and torments in this Life, only to purchaſe Eternal Happineſs for them; what Contents, what Delights will he give them, when they come to enjoy it? The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98258:109"/>the greatneſs, and the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of that infinite Ranſom was, that God gave his Life upon the Croſs for Man; but it is an eaſie thing for him to beſtow thoſe Joys, after he has paid the Purchaſe. How great is that Glory, which he bought for the Juſt, when the Price of it was Infinite, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Price was the Blood of the Eternal Son of God? But after all in my judgment, the moſt proportionable meaſure to judge of it by, is St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, <hi>The eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, nor have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See then how light and trivial are the pains and torments of this Life, whereby we arrive at thoſe high Contentments. But to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and immenſity of this Joy, Delight, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Happineſs, and Glory, is to be added the Eternal duration thereof. To enjoy God for ever, to be freed from Sufferings, and to live poſſeſs'd of Joys for ever, for ever, for ever! an Happineſs that has no end; a Glory that ſhall never ceaſe; Delights that time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſume, having no power either upon them, or thoſe that enjoy them. In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Mortal Life our Delights (if there be any) either end of themſelves, or put an end to the Life of him that enjoys them. They end by their duration, and periſh even whilſt they are laſting, and deſtroy him that takes pleaſure in them, and are pain and death in the Image of Delights. But O the Eternal<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98258:110"/>and Coeleſtial Joys of Heaven, which live and laſt, and grow in their duration! They change Time to Eternity; their Being is Continuance; they laſt without ending, and are always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning anew; they are impoſſible to be loſt, and as impoſſible to be expreſs'd. For who is able to declare what it is to be Eternal? Since Eternity is an immenſe Ocean, whoſe bottom cannot be found; a moſt obſcure Abyſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ſunk all the Faculties of Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; an intricate Labyrinth, out of which there is no iſſue; a perpetual, invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and indeficient Preſent, without what was, or what ſhall be; a great Year, which ever begins, and is never to end; Finally, that which never can be comprehended or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> ſpeaking of God, confeſſes that it cannot be ſaid, what he is, but only what he is not, and beſides what he is. In like manner, Eternity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better be declared, than by what it is not, and beſides what it is. Eternity is not Time, it is not Space, it is not an Age, it is not a Million of Ages; but it is more than Time, Space, or Millions of Ages. The Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou now art, and which muſt ſhortly have an end, is not Eternity; the Health which thou at preſent enjoyeſt, is not eternal; thy Pleaſures and Entertainments are not eternal; thy Poſſeſſions and Treaſures are not eternal; that wherein thou truſteſt is not eternal; the Goods of this World, in which thou ſo much delighteſt, are not eternal. Thou muſt leave<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98258:110"/>them all. A far greater thing is Eternity, above Kingdoms, above Empires, and above all Felicities. 'Tis this that makes the Joys of Heaven ſo ineſtimably valuable, and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely excellent. Had they not an eternal durance, they would be incomparably leſs deſirable, but Eternity being annex'd to the fruition of them, enhances their worth above all poſſible compariſon. If we were to enjoy all the pleaſures of the Senſes for a thouſand Myriads of Years, but were to paſs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ought to change them all for one only Pleaſure, that would laſt for ever. Why then exchange we not one periſhing Pleaſure of the Earth, which is to laſt but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for all thoſe immenſe Joys, which we are to poſſeſs in Heaven for a World without end? All the Temporal Goods of the World might well be quitted for the ſecuring of only one, that were eternal; how is it then that we ſecure not all the eternal, by forbearing now and then one, which is Temporal? It would infinitely exceed the Dominion of the whole World, ſo long as the World ſhall laſt, to be Lord, but of one little Cottage for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Time holds no compariſon with it; all that is Temporal, how great ſoever, being to be eſteemed vile and baſe; and all that is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, how ſmall ſoever, high and precious. And that we may enlarge this Conſideration as much as poſſible, the very Being of God himſelf, if it were but for a time, might be quitted for ſome other infinitely leſs excellent,<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98258:111"/>which were Eternal. And ſhall then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man ſatisfie himſelf with thoſe poor Treaſures, which Death may rob him of to morrow, deſpiſing for them the Eternal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Heaven? For certain if God ſhould promiſe us to enjoy the pleaſure of one only Senſe for ever in the next Life, we ought for it to part with all the pleaſures we have in this: How huge a folly is it then, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing all thoſe immenſe Joys of Heaven, we will not for all them together part with ſome of thoſe poor ones on Earth? That having a ſure Proſpect of an everlaſting Recompence, we will not for the ſake and attainment of it deſpiſe temporal and uncertain Poſſeſſions? In Eternal Bleſſings, beſides their perpetual continuance, there is likewiſe this Advantage, that they are free from change, ſo as they can neither end nor diminiſh; and that whilſt Temporal Goods change and conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they remain in the ſame firm, ſtable, and immutable condition for all Eternity. Compare therefore the brevity and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the things of this Life, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs and eternal duration of thoſe of the other. Do but ſeriouſly obſerve the difference betwixt thoſe two words, <hi>Now</hi> and <hi>Ever.</hi> The Fools of this World ſay, <hi>Let us now rejoyce;</hi> The Wiſe and Vertuous ſay, <hi>It is better that we forbear our Pleaſures now, that we may hereafter enjoy Eternal Happineſs.</hi> The Worldlings ſay, <hi>Let us now live daintily, and fare deliciouſly;</hi> The Servants of Chriſt ſay,<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98258:111"/>
                     <hi>Let us dye in the Fleſh, that we may live ever without change.</hi> The Sinners ſay, <hi>Let us now enjoy the World;</hi> They who fear God, ſay, <hi>Let us flie from this unſtable World, that we may for ever enjoy the Coeleſtial.</hi> Compare theſe two, and ſee who are the wiſer; thoſe who aim only at what endures but this momentary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Now;</hi> or thoſe which look after Eternity, which laſts for <hi>Ever;</hi> thoſe who ſhall ſuffer eternally without any Profit at all, or thoſe who are content to ſuffer a little in this World, for ſo great a gain, as is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>In all reſpects therefore the eternal Goods are incomparably the moſt excellent, and moſt tranſcendently ſuperiour to all periſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Aſpire therefore unto them, and ſtrive to Purchaſe them, even at the loſs of all which is Temporal, and in this Life as much as may be to imitate the ſame Eternity, which is to be done by the Practice of thoſe three Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> recommends to us in theſe words: <hi>With Poverty of Spirit, with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Contrition of Heart is renewed in the Soul a Similitude and Image of that Eternity, which embraces all times. For with Poverty of Spirit we merit the future; with Meekneſs we poſſeſs the preſent; and with the Tears of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we recover what is paſt.</hi> Let all thine Actions be accompanied with this Thought, <hi>For Ever;</hi> that for ever ſhall be rewarded what thou doeſt well, and with this conſideration thou wilt not only animate thy ſelf to do good
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98258:112"/>works, but to do them well. If in all thy deeds thou wouldſt but propoſe to thy ſelf E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and wholly reſpect it, thou wouldſt find little difficulty in any good works thou goeſt about. Fix therefore thine Eyes and Thoughts upon that, which is to be given us, for that which may be done in a moment. Bleſſed be God, who beſtows upon us a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without end, for Troubles ſo ſhort, that they ſcarcely have a beginning. The Benefit which <hi>David</hi> reaped by this conſideration, was a firm Reſolution to mend his Life, and change into a new Man, animating himſelf to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Obſervance, and a more high Perfection. And ſo in that Pſalm, wherein he ſays, <hi>That he thought upon the days of Old, and the years of Eternity,</hi> he adds immediately the effect of his Meditation, ſaying, <hi>That he was to begin anew.</hi> Conſidering that Eternity never ends, but ſtill begins, and that it is wholly a beginning, he determined with ſuch new fervour to give a beginning to a more perfect Life, that he would never flag or be diſmayed in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it; willing in this to imitate Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which as it is ever beginning, ſo he would ever begin to deſerve it. And what great matter is it, if that which we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy for ever be ever in beginning, that we ſhould likewiſe be ever beginning to deſerve it? Our Reward is not to fail us, and therefore there is no reaſon, why we ſhould fail, and grow weary in our Service and Endeavours. Our Joy is ever to begin, why ſhould not then<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98258:112"/>our Endeavours be ever beginning? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we hope for, ſhall never have an end; why ſhould then our Deſervings ever ceaſe? We ought never to look back upon our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours paſt, but ſtill to animate our ſelves to labour anew for God and his Service, as did the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays of himſelf, That he did forget what was paſt, that he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his heart and mind, extending it for that which is to come; which the Apoſtle ſpake in a time when he had ſuffered much, and done ſuch Services to God in the good of Souls, that he had already laboured more than all the Apoſtles. After that he had entred into the Synagogues of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and publickly preached Jeſus Chriſt with the moſt evident danger of his Life; After that he had conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many People in <hi>Arabia, Tarſus,</hi> and
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> After he had diſtributed great Alms, gathering them with much labour, made long Journeys, and brought them unto the Poor in
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> After the ſuffering of innumerable Perſecutions, and after infinite more Services performed for the Church; After all theſe it ſeemed unto him, that he had ſuffered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, done nothing for Chriſt, and he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it all, as if it had been the firſt day of his Converſion, determining ſtill to do more, to ſuffer more, to labour more, to begin anew, eſteeming himſelf after ſo many Labours and Services an uſeleſs, unprofitable Servant, and to be far ſhort of deſerving that Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, which is reſerved for the Faithful in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98258:113"/>Glory. And indeed what proportion does a whole Life of Labours and Sufferings bear to an everlaſting Reward, and never-ending Joys? What Conditions canſt thou think too rigid to be performed, or what Calamities too hard to be undergone, for the attainment of an Immortal and Incorruptible Crown? If we would but allow this Point it's due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how ſlight ſhould we think all the Evils and Troubles of this World? How inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable are all Pains and Difficulties to them that have a Proſpect of thoſe future Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes?</p>
                  <p>Let me ſee thee, O God, in thy Glory, and let me ſuffer a thouſand Torments in this Life. till I come to ſee thee. Let me ſee you, O Bleſſed Angels, in Heaven, and let me ſuffer upon Earth, till I come to ſee you. Let me be admitted into your bleſſed Company, O happy Saints, hereafter, and let me ſuffer, whatever ye ſuffered, here. Come Pains and Puniſhments, ſo I may but ſee thoſe Eternal Joys and Contentments. Let me endure any thing in this Vale of Miſeries, ſo I may at laſt come to the City of God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> abounding in all manner of Joys and Comforts. Finally, O my Jeſus, do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou wilt with me here, ſo that I may but at laſt ſee, adore, praiſe, and enjoy thee for ever there.</p>

                     <head>Of the Myſtery of the Incarnation.</head>
                     <p>And firſt, behold and conſider the Eternal Son of God, Co-eternal, Co-omnipotent, and Infinitely Wiſe with the Father, coming forth from the Father (yet without leaving him) to be made Man; the Holy Ghoſt in this high Myſtery co-operating with the Father and the Son, for the Three Divine Perſons, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98258:114"/>in the Creation of Man, concurred alſo in his Reparation and Redemption. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he ſets forth accompanied with the whole Court of Heaven, and takes Fleſh in the chaſte Womb of the moſt pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Virgin that Nature ever ſaw, the moſt Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Honour of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> the Glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Joy of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold that unſpeakable Union between the Divinity and the Humanity; behold the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word cloathing himſelf with our Nature, and eſpouſing himſelf to it in that Virgin Bride-bed. Here thou mayeſt know what thou oweſt to thy Creator and Saviour, who for the love of thee, and for thy Remedy, made himſelf Man, took on him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and ſubjected himſelf to all the Labours and Miſeries, to which Mankind is liable; and together with our Nature loaded himſelf likewiſe with all their Pains and Puniſhments; and which is more, being Innocency itſelf, he took upon him all their Sins alſo, to ſuffer for them. Conſider thus, what God did for thee, and then conſider likewiſe what thou oweſt to God for having done all this for thee. That the Immenſe, the Omnipotent, and the Infinitely Wiſe ſhould become Man for the Redemption of Man! That thoſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams ſo diſtant and diſtinct ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; that the Nature of Man, which is Frailty and Miſery, ſhould be united to the Divine Perſon of the Eternal Son of God,<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98258:115"/>which is the Supream and Soveraign Deity! What greater cauſe can there be of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Admiration? Men uſe to ſay, when they would expreſs any thing impoſſible, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall meet, before this can come to paſs. Conſider how much greater a thing is God's joyning the Humanity with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity for my ſake, than the meeting of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. Can there be a greater Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than that God to ſhew his love to us, ſhould do impoſſibilities? Could Omnipotency want other means to Save and Redeem Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Could not his Infinite Wiſdom have contriv'd other ways for the Salvation of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> without engaging himſelf in this incomprehenſible expreſſion of Love? Yes, moſt probably. For to him that is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful, the moſt difficult things were very eaſie, and to him that is Infinitely Wiſe, they were alſo moſt clear and manifeſt; but his exceſſive Love would for the Salvation of Man, give that which was not preciſely neceſſary, and having it in his power to do leſs, for their ſakes he would needs do more.</p>
                     <p>O more than Infinite Goodneſs! O Love that exceedeſt all Conſideration! That thou the Immenſe, the Omnipotent, and Infinite God ſhouldſt be made Man, for Man! That thou ſhouldeſt ſo have limited thy ſelf, being the unbounded Creator of all things both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth! That thou ſhouldſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſo ſhort and narrow a ſpace; Thou, who comprehendeſt the whole Creation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98258:115"/>thy ſelf, and yet haſt infinite room within that unmeaſurable comprehenſion! That thou ſhouldſt become paſſible, being by thy Divine Nature incapable of Labour, Pains, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings! And not only paſſible, but already beginning actually to ſuffer, being Innocency and Goodneſs itſelf, and the very Original of all Goodneſs and Innocency! This does not only amaze Man's Underſtanding, but even that of the higheſt Cherubims; and only that ſame God can comprehend it, who celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and performed this high and Soveraign Myſtery.</p>
                     <p>Now let us come back to our ſelves, and conſider, what is it for Man, ſinful Man, to ſuffer, that drags ſo many Chains of Paſſions and Wickedneſſes, (it being juſt that he ſhould ſuffer for them) ſince this Divine Lord ſuffers a cloſe Reſtraint and Impriſonment in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin's Womb? What is it for Man to humble himſelf for God's ſake, ſeeing God for Man's ſake humbled himſelf ſo far, as even to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man? What a ſmall thing is it for Man to ſhut himſelf up in a Cell, or to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſtrait Encloſure in hope that he ſhall come forth to the enjoyment of Eternal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſince God the Son impriſons himſelf ſo cloſely for nine Months to come forth to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo many ways for Thirty and three years, that he might purchaſe and obtain that very Liberty for Man? What is it for the low, the mean, the vile, and the unworthy to humble himſelf; ſince the Divine, the Immenſe, the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98258:116"/>Omnipotent, the Infinite, and the moſt High hath abaſed himſelf to ſo great a degree? Draw from hence that Humility, which after a certain manner thou oughteſt to be proud of, as an Honour; ſince thou doſt that which God himſelf did, for it muſt needs be always a great Honour to do that which has been done by that Eternal Majeſty. Behold what thankfulneſs thou oweſt to that unſpeakable Goodneſs, for that wonderful expreſſion of his Love, in the Incarnation of the Son of the Eternal God, and how it can be poſſible for Man with ſufficient gratitude to acknowledge, that God ſhould make himſelf Man for the Redemption of Man, that he ſhould come down from Heaven to Earth, to make Earth an Inheritor of Heaven?</p>
                     <p>This in my Opinion was the greateſt of all the expreſſions of God's Love and Kindneſs; in this was the greateſt Conqueſt of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in this it was that he meaſured the moſt unmeaſurable diſtance. When once he was made Man, to ſuffer for Man was but an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſtance, although a very vaſt one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Man was God; but that being God, he ſhould make himſelf Man, was a Divine diſtance, and that ſo beyond all exceſs, that for the meaſuring of it, it was neceſſary that Omnipotency itſelf ſhould yield to the greater power of Love. When once he had made himſelf paſſible by becoming Man, it was ſo natural for him to ſuffer, that if he would have freed his Humanity from it, it muſt have been<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98258:116"/>by the help of his Divinity; but for him, being God, to make himſelf Man, that he might become paſſible; this was a Prodigy more than Divine, and which does almoſt ſeem incredible. Thoſe that are of High and Noble Birth avoid to come near the Plebeians and Vulgar ſort; thoſe that are Rich, ſcorn to have any thing to do with the Poor; and thoſe that are Wiſe, deſpiſe to talk with the Ignorant. But thou, O Eternal Wiſdom, Riches, and Nobility, not only cameſt near to our Poverty, our Baſeneſs, and our Frailty, but cloathed'ſt thy ſelf therewith, to inſtruct, to enrich, and to enoble our Nature. From henceforth, Lord, we ought to learn from thy Divinity, to humble and abaſe our ſelves, and to become Poor, that we may imitate thee in thy Humanity.</p>

                     <p>Behold now, when the appointed time for the Birth of the

He was born in a Stable amongſt Beaſts, coming to live amongſt bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Men; and he was laid in a Manger, that was to be the Food of Souls; and in an Inn, the common receptacle of all Comers, that all<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98258:117"/>might have acceſs to him, who was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saviour of all Mankind. Behold that poor Cottage of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> already transformed into a Heaven, and his ſuppoſed Father the chaſte
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> with the Bleſſed Virgin his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, kneeling to adore the Child of her Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, who alſo was her Maker, being the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the whole World. Behold all the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Spirits, buſie in worſhipping the Lord God, and in calling the Shepherds, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their true and eternal Shepherd. The Angels ſing, <hi>Glory to God on high, on Earth Peace, and good will towards men,</hi> exalting that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which had laid itſelf ſo low, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his Divinity at the ſame time that his Humanity appeared. Enter thou alſo with them, O my Soul, to adore the Divine Son of God, who had now cloathed himſelf with the Nature of Man, and fill'd it with greater Humanity and Love, than ever till that time it was capable of: Come thou therefore with love, and lay aſide thy fears; if thou art a Shepherd to others, thou art one of his Sheep. This chief Eternal Shepherd comes to call and to ſeed, not only the Sheep, but their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds alſo. Draw near, O my Soul, to that Manger, for his Deity and his Humility would have no greater Throne, to the end that thou mighteſt the better approach it. Seeing thy baſeneſs, his Divine Nature abaſed itſelf to the uttermoſt, to the end that the baſeneſs of thine might attain to ſo high a Greatneſs and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. Draw near, my Soul, be not afraid,<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98258:117"/>for his tender Mother holds him out to thee in her Arms, and calls thee to his Humanity, leſt his Divinity ſhould affright thee.</p>
                     <p>O Infant God, the Joy and Conſolation of Mankind! O Infant God, the Light of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Comfort of the Univerſe! O Infant God, the unſpeakable Delight of all Creatures, and the ſweeteſt Gladneſs of Souls! Why ſhould not I ſuffer for thee, ſince thou cameſt purpoſely into the World to ſuffer for me? O Immortal, and yet Mortal, Child, wherefore art thou in this Stable, wherefore weeping and ſuffering in this Manger, ſince thou art the Author of Grace, and of all that is Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Author of Delight, of Joy, and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Were it not better, O beautiful Infant, were it not fitter that Sin (that is I) ſhould ſuffer, than thou, who art Innocency itſelf? Were it not fitter that the wicked ſhould be in pain, than that thy Goodneſs ſhould endure it? What haſt thou done, O tender Infant, that thou bewaileſt the faults of others, and makeſt the puniſhments of them thine own? Wilt thou, O ſweeteſt Goodneſs, waſh my defiled Soul with thy Tears? Wilt thou, O lovely Child, by ſuffering Cold, inflame the coldneſs of my Heart; or doſt thou feel that cold, to reproach the coldneſs of my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? O Glory and Comfort of my Soul! Would God it were ſo clean and pure, that I might offer it inſtead of Swathes to enfold and to embrace thy tender Body. Would God it were full of Spiritual Flowers, and ſweet-ſmelling<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98258:118"/>Vertues, that I might lay them in that Manger inſtead of that ſtraw, which was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with bearing upon it that Divine Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grain, which is the Food and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that is created. But, O Holy and Eternal Infant, I have nothing in me to offer thee but Thorns; nothing but Sins and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in my Soul, and it is not juſt to anticipate thoſe Thorns, which muſt one day Crown thy ſacred Head; nor to begin ſo early to hurt that tender Body with them. O thou that art my Happineſs and my Glory, how ſoon do my Sins begin thy Puniſhment! How ſoon doth thy Love lye ſuffering between two Beaſts, dying for the love of Man, who within few years art to ſuffer Death between two Men? How ſoon, O my Jeſus, after thy Birth, art thou in the company of Beaſts, who art to live amongſt Beaſts, and to dye amongſt Beaſts of a more cruel kind? Theſe at thy Birth are much more innocent, for how brutiſh ſoever they be, yet the Ox knows his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib; but they would neither know nor receive their Saviour, but firſt they ſcourge and buffet, and then nail their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to the Croſs. Why doſt thou weep, O Heavenly Child? Yet ſince it is natural to thee to weep, becauſe thou haſt taken our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; weep, becauſe I do not weep, to the end that I may weep with thee; ſince thou ſigheſt, let it be becauſe I do not ſigh; ſince thou feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pains, let it be, becauſe I am inſenſible of thy pains, and let them beget in me a deep<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98258:118"/>ſenſe of my unworthineſs, that thou ſhouldſt ſuffer them for my ſake. Let thoſe Tears of thine become my Remedy and my Rejoycing; transfer them from thine eyes to mine, and as they waſh thy beautiful Cheeks, let them alſo waſh my polluted Soul. Transfer the love of thy tender heart to this obdurate heart of mine, and grant as it offends thee, ſo it may infinitely grieve for having offended thee, and deſire with paſſionate longing to adore and to embrace thee. Let the thought of that froſty Seaſon, wherein thou wert born, thaw this frozen heart of mine into a love of thee, that ſufferedſt that froſt for me, who am benumb'd with one more hard and laſting; for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome few weeks perhaps, but this of my heart has continued many years. O that I had ſuffered it for thee, dear Child! for the moſt rigorous froſt that is felt for thy ſake, is Warmth, is Love, and is not Ice, but Fire to kindle and inflame my heart. Thou wert born for my Happineſs, and for my Remedy, Grant, O dear Lord, that ſuch a Repentance; ſuch a Sorrow, and ſuch a Contrition may be born in my Soul, as may prepare and fit me for my Remedy, and grant that the light and power of thoſe Beams of Love, which dart from the beautiful Countenance of thy Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may drive away the darkneſs of Sin and Infidelity from my Soul, which thou cameſt to baniſh from thence, and may kindle in me ſuch a fire of love towards thee, as nothing may ever be able to extinguiſh it.</p>

                     <p>IT is hard to get out of this Cottage, that was honoured with the Birth of our Lord, which is the ſweeteſt Myſtery, and fill'd with the ſofteſt Expreſſions of his Love; but there is a neceſſity of waiting upon him through the other demonſtrations of it; and becauſe he came to Redeem us, it is very fit we ſhould follow him, that we may attain that Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſeem'd a ſmall thing to his Love, to ſhed tears for us in the cold he was expos'd to, by the openneſs of that inconvenient place; but he alſo ſhed his blood already for us, by being wounded with the Legal Knife.

                     <p>They bring back our Saviour wounded with Love and Grief, as well as with that knife, unto the Stable and the Manger; unleſs it was perhaps in that very place, that he pour'd forth his blood, as well as his tears. There they ſtay, till three Kings come to Adore him, in requital of that one, who ſought to deſtroy him. O how much greater a Kingdom did they find at the feet of this Coeleſtial Infant in the Manger, than in their own Royal Thrones. How much higher were they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by laying themſelves proſtrate before him, and to what an height were they exalted by having ſo humbled themſelves? By throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their Crowns at his feet, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed their Heads with brighter Crowns, and thoſe not earthly, but Crowns of Grace and Glory.</p>
                     <p>They preſented unto that Divine Child things Temporal; and he gave them things Heavenly and Eternal. The Gifts they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, were but tranſitory, but thoſe he filled them with, were permanent and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. They Offer to him Gold, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and Myrrh, and he in exchange gives<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98258:120"/>them the Golden Vertue of Charity, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of pure and fervent Devotion, and for Myrrh, the Grace of Mortification, whereby dying to this World, they began to live to that other, which never ſhall have end. O how much greater were thoſe Gifts, which were beſtowed on them by that little Child, than thoſe that were offered to him by thoſe great Kings! They preſented to him Gold, as to the Creator of all the Riches of Heaven and of Earth, and he in exchange gave them the Riches of the Earth and Heaven. They gave him Incenſe, the perfume whereof aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from Earth towards Heaven, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him God as well as Man; and he gave them Grace, as an Earneſt, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo ſhould aſcend into Heaven. They gave him Myrrh, as to a Mortal Man, and he in being Mortal, did by his death quicken them to live with him for ever in his Glory.</p>
                     <p>Let us offer to him, with thoſe Kings, that which thoſe Kings did offer; let us offer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, Charity, Mortification, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; let us offer to him a Life, that from this day may aſpire to an Eternal Life; let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto him Ardent Love, Fervent Prayers, and Humble Penitence; let us offer to him all the Actions of our Life, and let us take care, that all our Actions be ſuch, as may be fit to be offered to him. We may well draw near with an humble confidence to adore this Child, who ſuffered himſelf to be approached by Children, and to be adored by the pooreſt<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98258:120"/>Men, as well as by the richeſt Kings. He was born poor himſelf, to the end, that he may be found by thoſe that are poor; and a Child, that he may be ador'd by little ones, <hi>for even out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings he has ordained ſtrength, and perfected praiſe.</hi> Come with Humility and Aſſurance to make him an Offering of thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt find him tender, and wounded with Love, readily to accept thy Offering.</p>
                     <p>But what can I offer to thee, O Glorious Infant; I, who am meer Poverty? What Gold of Charity, being with thee at Enmity? What Works of Repentance, being full of Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Rebellion, and Impenitency? What De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, my Prayers being full of wandring Thoughts and Diſtractions? O my God, I come not only to adore thee, but alſo to beg of thee. Lord, I believe that I pleaſe thee more in asking of thee, than in giving to thee. Such is thy Charity, thy Goodneſs, thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Liberality, that to exerciſe it, and to be giving, is thy Glory; and thou rejoyceſt much more in that thou beſtoweſt, than in all thou canſt receive from us poor neceſſitous Beggars. And what can we beſtow on thee, O Infant God, we that are nothing but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? What can we give but trifles unworthy of a God, and only tolerable for a meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Child, but far unfit for thee, who art alſo God? Thou alone canſt give us what we ought to give thee; and if the Gift, which we ought to offer thee, come not firſt from thine<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98258:121"/>hand, the worth of it can be no ways ſuitable to ſuch an Hand, to ſuch a Child, and to ſuch a God.</p>
                     <p>Finally, it is from hence thou muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw thoſe Gifts that thou oughteſt to Preſent him; It is from himſelf thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Gold, the Frankincenſe, and the Myrrh, in Prayer, Charity, and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From hence thou muſt procure a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity burning with the love of that Lord, a Mortification conſtant in ſuffering for him, that ſuffered for thee; that ſuffered cold, and ſhed his blood in that mean place for thy ſake. In ſhort, from hence thou muſt draw an earneſt and fervent Devotion to contemplate and adore ſo many, and ſo great Benefits, without ſuffering them to ſlip out of thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and him, whom thoſe Kings ſought in that particular place, thou muſt love, ſeek, follow, and adore, in all places, whereſoever thou ſhalt happen to be.</p>

<hi>and for a ſign, which ſhall be ſpoken againſt, yea, and a ſword ſhall pierce through thine own Soul alſo.</hi> There the Virgin-Mother ſaw the future Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her Son Propheſied of unto her, and her heart was wounded with a Mortal ſtroke of Grief, and of Compaſſion. From that moment ſhe never wanted Sufferings, nor did that Sword, foretold by
<hi>Simeon,</hi> ever depart from her Soul.</p>
                     <p>Thus he ſubjected himſelf to the Law, who was exempt from all Law, and who came to give us Laws; and ſhall thou and I be ſo vain, and proud, and fooliſh, as to ſhake off from us the neceſſary Yoke of Laws? Does he obey, to whom all ought to be obedient; and ſhall thou and I, who are born only to obey, reſiſt Humility and Obedience? No, let us ſubmit<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98258:122"/>to our Superiours, and obey not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience-ſake; and let us pray unto God, that as his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt ſubmitted himſelf to be preſented in the Temple in the ſubſtance of our Fleſh, ſo we may be preſented unto him with pure and clean hearts, by the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

For though the Jews in one of the Evangeliſts call him but a Carpenter's Son; in another they asked, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> Some of them probably having ſeen him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that Profeſſion. Behold the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things ſubjecting himſelf to his own mean Creatures; and thou rebellious and wretched Creature, wilt not thou ſubmit thy ſelf to thy great Creator?

Behold him helping to build Houſes for others, who never had one of his own to reſt his head in. Imitate him in his laborious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and give not up thy ſelf to ſloth and

Though God hath given thee Riches, ſo that thou art not forced to work for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, remember that a ſlothful hand tendeth to Poverty; and if thou exerciſeſt thy ſelf in ſome manual Buſineſs, thou wilt be the better able to bear a low Condition, if thy uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Riches ſhould make themſelves wings, and flie away. Learn alſo to be contented in the pooreſt Eſtate, by his Example, who in this World was worſe provided for than the Foxes, for they have Holes; or the Birds of the Air, for they have Neſts.

                  <p>NOW I will ſhew thee the Original, of which thou oughteſt to be a Copy, and the Looking-glaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou oughteſt to dreſs thy ſelf; I mean the Actions of our Lord, which hitherto have been unſpeakable Myſteries; but now beſides being Myſteries, they begin to be Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Inſtructions, Lights, Counſels, and Informations of the Spiritual Life.</p>
                  <p>Behold how after Eighteen Years of Silence and Obedience, our Saviour at the Age of Thirty begins to teach and direct Souls. A rare and admirable Example, teaching us, that we ought to reſtrain our ſelves, and not be too haſty in getting up into Offices and Preferments, but to fear them, and to learn firſt, that we may be afterwards able to teach; ſince he did ſo, who had no need of learning,<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98258:125"/>and who was Wiſdom itſelf, that came to teach us. Do thou love Obedience, Patience, and Silence, and if thou wouldſt learn to Teach and Govern, learn firſt to Obey, and to hold thy peace:</p>
                  <p>Behold how that Lamb of God goes to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> to ſeek his Holy Fore-runner, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who pointed out the Saviour of Souls with his finger, bearing Witneſs that it was He, who came to take away the ſins of the World. See how preſently going into the Water to be baptized, he was not ſo much waſhed himſelf, as he purified and cleanſed the Waters with his Innocency and Holineſs, and by them our ſins; leaving us the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Remedy of Baptiſm, the Gate of the Church, the ineffable Seal, and myſterious Character of Humane Redemption, and of Chriſtian Vocation. Behold, how the Father acknowledges his beloved Son, in whom he declares himſelf well pleaſed. Behold the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt alſo appears upon him in the viſible form of a Dove, the whole Trinity co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Inſtitution of that Holy Sacrament. Pray to him, to reſtore unto thee that Robe of Grace, which he gave thee in thy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and which thou haſt loſt by thy many ſins. Beg of him to renew it by his Vertues, and amongſt the reſt, by the chiefeſt, which is final Perſeverance. Conſider what Thanks thou oweſt unto this Lord, for having cauſed thee to be born where thou hadſt the benefit of this bleſſed Sacrament, and wert made<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98258:125"/>capable of thoſe Heavenly Bleſſings, which by it are brought into thy Soul.</p>
                  <p>Behold in the next place, how our Lord goes to the Deſart to Faſt forty days, that he might conſecrate Faſting to us by his Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; and the labours and difficulties of a Spiritual Life, by being tempted. If the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, who is Goodneſs and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency itſelf, did Faſt, have not I need to do ſo, being meer Wickedneſs, Exceſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency? If the Eternal Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creator of all things, ſuffered himſelf to be tempted by our common Enemy the Devil, why ſhould thou and I, who are vile Worms of the Earth, think it much to ſuffer Temptations and Tribulations; ſince our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Wickedneſs for the moſt part give nouriſhment to thoſe very Temptations, and that we very often run into them by tempting our ſelves? See how he conquers both the Tempter and the Temptation, the one by his Abſtinence, and the other by his Humility and Patience, chooſing thoſe two Vertues for an Univerſal Remedy of all the Diſeaſes of the Soul. Humble thy ſelf therefore, and be confounded in the knowledge of thy Miſery, and when thou art tempted, (ſince Chriſt himſelf was ſo) do thou imitate him in a firm and reſolute Reſiſtance, patiently relying upon his ſtrength, who with the Temptation will make a way for thee to eſcape, and will deliver thee when thou calleſt upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:98258:126"/>Behold now, how he chooſes his Apoſtles, the firſt Pillars of the Chriſtian Religion, and the chief Maſters of the Spiritual Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with two poor Fiſher-men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent all the Night toyling in vain, and caught nothing, taught us Obedience by their readily letting down the Nets again at his Command; which was well rewarded by the Miraculous draught of Fiſh, with which they themſelves were caught, and were from that time made fiſhers of Men. Theſe he increaſed to the number of Twelve, moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that mean Profeſſion; whoſe Poverty and Ignorance he choſe to confound Humane Wiſdom and Greatneſs, that to neither of them, but to his Grace alone might be acknowledged the conquering and confounding of the moſt preſumptuous Power, Knowledge, and Vanity of this World. Therefore love Poverty, and believe that the Kingdom of God cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Riches and Greatneſs, unleſs they be mingled with Humility.</p>
                  <p>Mark how he begins his holy Preaching with that Divine Sermon in the Mount, the Matter whereof has been the Subject of all Sermons ever ſince. Read it often, till thou haſt fixed it in thy Memory, and have it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before the eyes of thy Mind, to follow it in thy Practiſe. Let the Prayer he teaches there, be the Pattern of all thy Prayers; In the three firſt Petitions whereof thou mayeſt learn thy Duty towards God; to Sanctifie his Name, to reſign thy ſelf to his Will in all
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98258:126"/>things, and to love him above thy Life in long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Kingdom, which thou canſt not enter into, but by Death. Learn in the other three thy Duty towards thy Neighbour, in loving him as thy ſelf; ſince by uſing the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Number, thou beggeſt all thoſe Bleſſings for others, which thou deſireſt for thy ſelf; and askeſt to be forgiven thy Offences towards God no otherwiſe, than as thou thy ſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveſt thoſe that are done unto thee by Men: And ſince the doing good to all, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving all Injuries, is the greateſt perfection of Chriſtianity, and the thing wherein we moſt reſemble our Bleſſed Saviour; be ſure amongſt all thoſe excellent Leſſons of that Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to make that one of doing to others, whatſoever thou wouldſt have them do to thee, the continual Rule of all thy Actions; for that will make thee to love and to do good unto all, becauſe thou wouldſt have all to love, and to do good unto thee; and it will make thee forgive the greateſt Injuries that any Enemy can do unto thee, becauſe thou wouldſt have no body to take Revenge for thoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from thee.</p>
                  <p>When the Holy Jeſus had ended his Sermon on the Mount, that Divine Repoſitory of the moſt excellent Truths, containing a Breviary of all thoſe Precepts, which make up and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Morality of the Chriſtian Religion; he deſcended into the Valleys to conſign his Doctrine by the power of Miracles, which were next to Infinite, and which, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98258:127"/>he choſe to inſtance in actions of Mercy, that all his Powers might eſpecially determine upon Bounty and Charity, and at the ſame time be invincible Arguments of the Divinity of his Perſon and Doctrine. Almoſt all the Miraculous Works he did during his Natural Life were actions of Relief and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he might at once, both do good to Men, and alſo demonſtrate his Miſſion from God; which indeed was the principal deſign of all his Miracles, which being ſo infinitely and apparently above the power of Nature, could not but create great confidence in his Diſciples, that himſelf would verifie thoſe great Promiſes upon which he eſtabliſhed his Law, nor fail to make a very deep impreſſion upon all Perſons whoſe intereſt and love of the World did not deſtroy the Piety of their Wills, and put their Underſtandings into Fetters. So marvellous was the force of Conviction by theſe ſupernatural Operations, that to minds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſs'd and honeſtly diſpos'd to receive the truth, it was hardly reſiſtible. Who could chuſe but be wrought upon to confeſs his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, from the ſight of that firſt Miracle, which he wrought after his deſcent from the Mount, upon the poor leprous Perſon, which came to him worſhipping him, and begging to be healed. He did but barely put forth his hand and touch him, and immediately his Leproſie was cleanſed. What ſo great Vertue could poſſibly proceed from Natural Agents; or from whence could ſo ſudden and effectual<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98258:127"/>a Remedy come, but from that Great and Heavenly Phyſician, who is Lord of Nature, and conſequently has no need to uſe Phyſical means, but by a word of his mouth can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh whatever he pleaſes, both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth? He bad the Man go to the Prieſt to offer an Oblation according to the Rites of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, hereby teaching what Reſpect and Obedience we owe to the Laws of that Religion which is duly eſtabliſhed. For in all the wonderful Works which he wrought for the healing Men's Bodies, he had this further deſign to heal their Minds too, by inſinuating good Inſtructions. He was a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Souls as well as of Bodies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had an eye to the Spiritual benefit of Men, by contributing to their bodily eaſe. This Obſervation holds in all thoſe Corporal Cures, which he wrought for the outward good of Men by that Divine Power, which God had anointed him with. As his Miracles were intended for Mercy, ſo alſo for Doctrine. The Impotent and Diſeaſed Perſons were not more cured, than we inſtructed; which will appear, if we caſt an eye upon ſome of his Miraculous Cures.</p>
                  <p>Behold him then in the next place giving ſight to the Blind; to one, who beſides his blindneſs was alſo poſſeſs'd with a dumb De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which being caſt out, he preſently ſpake and ſaw; to another, by anointing his Eyes with Clay and Spittle, which one would think were more likely to have blinded him, if he<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98258:128"/>could have ſeen; and even to one that was born blind, without any natural capacity of receiving ſight; which more increaſed the Wonder of the Multitude, all confeſſing, That ſince the beginning of the World it was never known, that any one had received ſight, who was born blind. And do not theſe Examples teach us to admire his Goodneſs and his Power, which working both with means, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means, nay, and againſt means too, may convince us of his being God as well as Man? How ſhould we be excited by this exceſſive Bounty of our Lord, to beg of him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the blindneſs of our Underſtandings, which is far greater and worſe than the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Men; and to give us ſuch a clear ſight of Heavenly things, as may make us look upon all the Greatneſs, the Riches, and the Pleaſures of this World only with Contempt and Pity; that we may plainly perceive the Path that leads to eternal Happineſs, and avoid all thoſe ſtumbling-blocks which are laid in the way? O thou that openedſt the Eyes of the Blind, ſuffer not the thick Miſts of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to obſcure and darken my mind, and ſo hinder it from ſeeing and knowing in my day, the things which belong to my Peace, that they may never be hid from me.</p>
                  <p>See in another place a Noble Perſonage coming to Jeſus with much Reverence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him with great importunity to come to his Houſe, and cure his Son, being now ready to dye. Jeſus, who did not do his Miracles<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98258:128"/>by Natural Operations, cured the Child at a diſtance and diſmiſſed the Prince telling him his Son lived; which he found to be true, and that he recovered at that time, when Jeſus ſpake thoſe ſalutary and healing words. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he and all his Houſe became Diſciples, and were throughly convinced of his being the true
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that Salvation was only through him; which effect the Miracle did naturally tend to produce.</p>
                  <p>Behold at another time, how ſoundly he ſleeps in the midſt of a moſt violent Tempeſt, which ſo affrighted his Diſciples, that they haſtily awoke him, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi> Thus quietly do they reſt in the midſt of dangers, which truſt in God; and ſo are they diſmayed with fears, who dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an entire confidence in him. Imitate thou his Diſciples in having recourſe to Prayer in all thy diſtreſſes, but rely upon God with aſſurance of his help. Obſerve how their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt was check'd with a, <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith!</hi> Yet his Mercy granted their Requeſt, for he preſently rebuked the Winds and the Seas, and their was a great Calm. In like manner, O Lord, compoſe the ſtorms of my troubled Breaſt, appeaſe the boiſterous Winds of my unruly Paſſions, and the rolling Billows of my exorbitant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady Deſires. Say unto them as thou didſt unto the Sea, <hi>Peace and be ſtill;</hi> ſo ſhall I ſafely paſs through the Tempeſtuous Waves of this miſerable World with a calm and contented
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98258:129"/>mind, till I arrive at the Haven of endleſs Reſt and Comfort in thy Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Nor does he only quiet the Sea, but walks upon the Waters of it, which ſeem'd ſo ſtrange to his Diſciples, that they took him for a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. St. <hi>Peter</hi> having his Maſter ſtill in his thoughts, that he might be certain, calls out, <hi>If it be Thou, command me to come to thee.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtrength of his Love, which makes him deſirous to be with Jeſus in any place, how dangerous ſoever; and yet the weakneſs of his Fear, which preſently cauſes his Faith to fail, though he had an Omnipotent hand ready to help him. His heart firſt ſinks in his Body, and then his Body ſinks in the Water. Learn then to follow Chriſt, by imitating the Vertues which he practiſed as Man; his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Meekneſs, Humility, and Charity; and do not affect to do thoſe things which he performed as God. It is enough for us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo Dangers, when Providence ſhall bring them upon us, and too much to run our ſelves into them unneceſſarily; for that is to tempt God by a vain Preſumption, the Puniſhment whereof is to be left to our ſelves, and moſt probably to periſh in our own raſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>Let us next accompany our Saviour to the Marriage in
<hi>Cana,</hi> (and indeed there it was that he wrought his firſt Miracle) where to reſcue the married Pair, who were poor, and wanted Wine, from Affront and Trouble, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Water-pots to be filled with Water, which by his Divine Power he changed into<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98258:129"/>Wine; where the different proceeding of God and the World is highly obſervable. <hi>Every man ſets forth good Wine at firſt, and then the worſt;</hi> but God not only turns the Water into Wine, but into ſuch Wine, that ſtill the laſt draught is moſt pleaſant. The World preſents us with fair Language, promiſing Hopes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Fortunes, pompous Honours, and theſe are the outſides of the Bole; but when it is ſwallowed, theſe diſſolve in the inſtant, and there remains nothing but bitterneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Every ſin ſmiles in the firſt Addreſs, but when we have well drunk, then comes that which is worſe, Fears and Terrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Shame and Diſpleaſure, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the day of Death. But when after the manner of the purifying of the Chriſtians, we fill our Water-pots with Water, watering our Couch with our Tears, and moiſtening our Cheeks with the perpetual diſtillations of Repentance; then Chriſt turns our Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine; firſt Penitents, and then Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; firſt Waters of Sorrow, and then the Wine of the Chalice; firſt the Juſtifications of Correction, and then the Sanctifications of the Sacrament, and the Effects of the Divine Power, Joy, and Peace, and Serenity, hopes full of Confidence, and Confidence without Shame, and Boldneſs without Preſumption; for Jeſus keeps the beſt Wine till the laſt; not only becauſe of the reſervations of the higheſt Joys till the nearer approaches of Glory, but alſo becauſe our reliſhes are higher after a long<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98258:130"/>enjoyment, than at the firſt Eſſays; ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Grace, that it encreaſes in Reliſh, as it does in Enjoyment; every part of Grace being a new Duty, and new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Next, let us contemplate thoſe moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and indubitable effects of a Power truly Divine and All-ſufficient, that our Saviour wrought in raiſing the Dead, and recalling Life and Breath into them; which is a Work that baffles all the Powers of Nature, and is too difficult to be compaſſed by a limited Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. See how he comforts <hi>Jairus,</hi> one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, when certain Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers came and declared to him the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Daughter, (whom having left at home at the point of Death, he came to Jeſus to beg a Cure for her,) and deſired him to trouble the Maſter no further. <hi>Be not afraid,</hi> ſays he, <hi>only believe;</hi> As if he had ſaid, Trouble not thy ſelf at this doleful Meſſage, neither be grieved for thy Daughter, for I am as able to reſtore her to Life now ſhe is Dead, as I was to heal her when ſhe was Sick, had I had a timely notice of her illneſs. Only have Faith in me, and believe that I am able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this great Action, and it ſhall preſently be accompliſhed: And according as he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo was the event, for entring in, where the Damſel was lying, he took her by the Hand, and ſaid unto her,
<hi>Talitha cumi,</hi> that is, <hi>Damſel ariſe,</hi> and immediately ſhe aroſe and walked, to the great Aſtoniſhment and Joy of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98258:130"/>thoſe that were mourning and weeping for her Deceaſe. In like manner our Lord beholding another Object of Pity, namely, the Widow of
<hi>Nain,</hi> bewailing and lamenting the Death of her only Son, who was now carrying to be Buried, had compaſſion on her, and bad her forbear weeping, for that her Son ſhould be reſtored to her again; and by the Voice of his Mouth, which commands the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and awakens the Dead, recover Senſe and Motion, which was ſoon effected; for he did but call, <hi>Young man, I ſay unto thee ariſe, and forthwith he that was dead, ſate up and began to ſpeak;</hi> whereupon, there came a fear on all: And being ſtruck with amazement at the ſight of ſo marvellous an Action, they glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, ſaying, A great Prophet is riſen up among us, and God hath viſited his People. At another time, he exerciſed this Supernatural and Divine Vertue, in raiſing up his beloved Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, who had been buried four Days, and had ſeen Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Siſters
<hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> in his Sickneſs, ſent to Jeſus, ſaying, <hi>Behold he, whom thou lovest is ſick.</hi> Jeſus permitted him to taſte of Death, that the Glory of God might be manifeſted in his return to Life. He deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to get him Glory by his Reſurrection; and therefore when he knew of his Death, he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Our friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but I go, that I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi> As he went, he was met by <hi>Martha,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with this mournful Lamentation;<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98258:131"/>
                     <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;</hi> (the ſame words wherewith <hi>Mary</hi> received him afterwards, when ſhe came to him) but however (taking comfort by Faith) I know, ſaid ſhe, <hi>That even now whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</hi> Jeſus anſwered her, <hi>Thy brother ſhall riſe again, and that not only at the last day,</hi> (as ſhe underſtood him)
<hi>but inſtantly:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he demanded where they had laid him; and coming to the place, he bad them <hi>take away the ſtone from the cave,</hi> which being done, <hi>He cried with a loud voice,</hi> Lazarus <hi>come forth;</hi> at the ſound of which words, the ſlumbring Carcaſs was awakened, all its parts revived, and his Soul re-united to his Body. So readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do all Creatures obey when God commands. Theſe Inſtances our Lord deſigned as Types of our riſing again at the final Conſummation of the World to an immortal State, <hi>When our corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal immortality.</hi> As they were raiſed again to a Temporal Being, ſo ſhall we to an Eternal, in Joy or Miſery. How greatly then does it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us ſo to frame our lives in this World, that we may be counted worthy to riſe again to eternal Life, and not to Eternal Death. Can we truly and heartily believe, that our Souls and Bodies ſhall be re-united at the laſt Day, and be called before Chriſts Tribunal to be judged and ſentenced according to their Deeds here, and yet live in a careleſs ſecurity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever regarding to ſet right our Accounts,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98258:131"/>before we appear at that Judgment-ſeat? Can any thing be more abſurd, than to entertain this Faith, and yet to live as if we utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd it? If we were really perſwaded and convinced of this grand Truth and Article of Chriſtianity, and would often meditate upon it, we ſhould not fail to guard ourſelves againſt the aſſaults of Sin, and enchantments of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly, and to apply our whole Endeavours to prepare our Souls and Bodies, for a glorious and

                  <p>Finally, (to name no more of our Lord's Miracles) let us come to that Sign, which was given to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to cure (if poſſible) their obſtinate Incredulity; that greateſt of Miracles, which could have no ſuſpicion of Impoſture, no Inſtance, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or Imitation; and that is, Jeſus, his own lying in the Grave three Days and three Nights, and then his raiſing up himſelf again, and appearing unto many, and converſing for forty Days together; giving probation of his riſing, and of the verity of his Body; and making a glorious promiſe, which at <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was verified. He by his Omnipotency raiſed his Body from the Dead, and enlivened it, according to that Prediction of his, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will build it up again.</hi> What more pregnant evidence could poſſibly be afforded, of his being the Son of God, than this ſublime Miracle? This one would think, were enough to conquer the<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98258:132"/>

                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:98258:133"/>moſt inveterate Infidelity, and to baniſh the leaſt doubt or ſuſpicion of our Saviour's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. O my Soul, do thou endeavour herein to reſemble Chriſt: As he died and roſe again for thee, ſo do thou die from Sin, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto Righteouſneſs and Newneſs of Life, ſeeking thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt is aſcended, and praying to him to quicken thy ſinful and earthly Heart with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſires, and heavenly Affections. That Infinite Power, which did ſo ſolemnly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Death and the Grave, can much more eaſily roll away the Stone of a cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin, and ſubdue and mortifie the moſt powerful Luſt, though of never ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and enable thee to live henceforward to God, in a careful obſervance of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Duties, which will at length bring thee to the end of thy Hopes; to thoſe Glories, which being the Portion of Angels and Saints, and the neareſt Communications with God, are infinitely above what we ſee, for hear, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>After the Miracles of our Saviour, ſucceed his Parables; which way of Expreſſion was abundantly uſeful, and recommended it ſelf chiefly upon this account. That whatſoever was repreſented in this Figurative manner, was apt to inſinuate more cloſely, and to work more powerfully upon the Affections. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in this caſe the mind was not only addreſſed to, by the meer dint of Reaſon; but Truth was in a manner made Viſible, and<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98258:133"/>ſet off in ſuch lively Colours, that the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being Impregnated, the Paſſions were eaſily carried along too. Hereby alſo the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was exceedingly fortified; for ſuch things as we feel and ſee, or which our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations have an expreſs Image of, and our Affections reliſh; thoſe things always ſtick by us. And further, this way of Parables, which our Saviour made ſo frequent uſe of, in many caſes came more home to Mens Conſciences, and carried more Conviction, than any other more expreſs and direct way of ſpeaking: And had it not been, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with Intollerable Prejudices againſt him, they muſt of neceſſity have had his Wiſdom in great Veneration. For though under his Parables were hid myſterious Senſes; yet they were not ſo myſterious, but that they were eaſily intelligible to Minds unprejudiced, honeſt, and deſirous of Inſtruction. The Truth ſhines through the Veil, and the Shadow does itſelf guide to the Body and Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>How excellently did our Lord repreſent the great Efficacy of Repentance under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ſtate, and its acceptableneſs with God from the vileſt Sinners, under the Parable of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son? The
<hi>Phariſees</hi> who were hardened in Infidelity, for the ſake of this Doctrine, accounted him a Friend of Vicious and Lewd Perſons. They knew that the Law gave hopes of Pardon only to ſome ſmaller Offences, excluding all great and notorious Offenders, and ſhutting them up under Wrath; and they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98258:134"/>not being elevated above this literal Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would not believe that God would exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Mercy upon any other Terms, than what he therein proclaimed; and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Preaching Repentance, and giving hopes of Pardon to the greateſt Sinners, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of an hearty and thorough Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe demure Hypocrites were offended, and inſinuated a ſuſpicion of our Saviour, That he was a favourer of wicked Perſons. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this unjuſt Imputation, and to ſilence the murmuring of theſe hard-hearted <hi>Jews,</hi> our Saviour makes uſe of this Parable, with two others of the like nature, wherein he plainly ſets forth this great Doctrine; and ſhews, that as it is the common courſe of Men to expreſs moſt Joy upon the recovery of any thing loſt; ſo God, to whom the Souls of Men are infinitely valuable, is highly pleas'd with the recovery of loſt Sinners, and upon their returning to him, will mercifully accept them, as the Indulgent Father here embraced his returning Son, who had been ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the moſt wild Extravagancies, and in the greateſt Diſobedience to his Paternal Authority. O the merciful Compaſſion of God to Mankind! O Love, that ſurpaſſeſt all Underſtanding! That the worſt of Sinners ſhould be received into favour, and be made capable of Pardon, only by repenting of their Wickedneſs, and being ſorry for their Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:98258:134"/>In another Parable, to wit, that of the Talents, how forcibly does our Lord inſtruct us in the Duties of Induſtry, Diligence, and Spiritual Husbandry? How plainly does he teach us the neceſſity of improving thoſe Gifts and Graces, which God communicates to us for that purpoſe, and to encreaſe thoſe Talents which he entruſts us with, and which he will call us to an account for, how we have uſed them, and what we have gained by them? He ſets before us the Reward of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful employing of them to the Uſes deſigned, and the Puniſhment of a neglectful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Thoſe that had gained by their Talents, were pronounced good and faithful Servants, and commanded to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Maſters Joy; but he that had hid his Talent in the Earth, and made no advantage of it, was branded with the infamous name of wicked and ſlothful Servant, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be caſt into outer Darkneſs. In like manner God will require an account of us, how we have uſed all thoſe Gifts and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he has beſtowed upon us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Goods of Fortune, or of Grace. We are miſtaken, if we think them given meerly for our ſakes. Have we the Bleſſing of a plentiful Fortune? God entruſts us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to make us capable to do good, and to relieve the neceſſities of our poor Brethren; and unleſs we thus uſe it, it will prove a Curſe to us. Are we favoured with extraordinary Endowments of Mind? It is, that we may
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98258:135"/>inſtruct the Ignorant, and employ them to the Glory of God, and to the good of others, which are deſtitute of ſo great a benefit. Is God pleaſed to infuſe his Grace into our Hearts? it muſt then be our daily endeavour to grow therein, and to add one Vertue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. We muſt faithfully employ and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the firſt beginnings, to the end, that we may obtain ſtill greater degrees. God will Reward or Puniſh us according to the good or ill Employment of his Goods, which he makes us Stewards of; If we give diligence to add to thoſe Talents, of whatſoever nature they be, which he depoſits with us; then no doubt God will honour us with the Title of faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and abundantly recompenſe our Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; but if through Idleneſs and Sloth, we ſo employ our Talents, as to bring in no gain to our Lord; we muſt expect nothing, but that diſmal Sentence denounced againſt the ſlothful Servant; <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable Servant into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another moſt uſeful and profitable Doctrine is taught us in the Parable of the Ten Virgins going forth to meet the Bridegroom; which is that of Vigilance or Watchfulneſs, and a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparation for Death and Judgment. As the exact time of the Bridegrooms coming was unknown to them, ſo is our latter end to us. And as the Door was ſhut againſt the fooliſh Virgins, and they excluded from the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for their unpreparedneſs at the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98258:135"/>coming; ſo the Door of Mercy will for ever be ſhut upon us, if we ſuffer ourſelves to be ſurpriz'd by Death, without making a due preparation for it. The coming of the Lord to Judgment, will be as a Snare on all them that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth. Let us Watch therefore and Pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that we may be found worthy to ſtand before the Son of Man.</p>
                  <p>We are likewiſe taught to pray inſtantly and perſeveringly, by the Parable of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Widow, whom the unjuſt Judge, that feared not God, nor regarded Man, did yet condeſcend to avenge of her Adverſaries, meerly becauſe of her Importunity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Entreaties, that he might not be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her continual coming. If this unjuſt Judge could by this means be mov'd to do right, and to hearken to the Petition of the oppreſſed Widow; How much more will God hear thy Prayers, if thou continueſt inſtant in ſoliciting his Divine Majeſty? If at the firſt thy requeſts be not granted, yet ceaſe not thy Addreſſes, nor give over praying, but contend and wreſtle, as it were with God, till thou gaineſt a hearing. God loves ſuch an holy Violence. Firſt ſee, that the matter of thy Petitions be juſt, lawful and convenient; and then thou mayeſt be ſure to obtain them, or ſomething better, if thou perſevereſt with Faith and Patience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:98258:136"/>Another moſt neceſſary Duty is very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enforc'd in the Parable of the King, which would take Account of his Servants, I mean the Duty of forgiving Offences and Injuries. When he began to reckon with them, one was brought to him, which owed him ten thouſand Talents; but being utterly uncapable of ever diſcharging ſo vaſt a Debt, he fell down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lord, and with great Humility and Earneſtneſs entreated him to have patience with him, whereupon he freely forgave him the whole Sum. But this ſame Servant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeverely exacting a far leſs conſiderable Debt of an hundred Pence of one of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants, and notwithſtanding all entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties caſting him into Priſon, till Payment ſhould be made, his Lord thus expoſtulates with him;
<hi>O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me; ſhouldeſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him.</hi> This is our caſe; as the Servant's Debt to his Maſter was great and important, and that of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervant to him but trivial and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: So our Offences againſt God are infinite, and of a provoking Nature; and the Injuries of our fellow-Creatures to us are but few, and of ſmall importance; if therefore we deſire God to pardon our hainous and often-repeated ſins againſt him, how can we refuſe to pardon the petty and ſmall Affronts of our Brethren?<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98258:136"/>With what Modeſty canſt thou, who denyeſt to forgive thy Brother one ſingle Treſpaſs, expect that God ſhould forgive thee ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand? Or how canſt thou hope for the Mercy of God, who art moſt cruel and unmerciful to others? Revenge, as it is an unchriſtian Principle, ſo it tends directly to unqualifie us for forgiveneſs, and is uncapable of the leaſt rational defence; for no man ever did or can forgive his Neighbour ſo many Provocations and Offences, as he himſelf has need to be forgiven by God; which is an eternal Reaſon and Motive to incite us to the exerciſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Mercy, and cannot fail to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ingenuous and conſidering Minds. Can there be a greater Argument devis'd to make us eaſie and willing to pardon Offences, than the conſideration of that abſolute neceſſity we our ſelves ſtand in of God's Pardon, without which we muſt eternally periſh? Eſpecially ſince our Saviour has plainly revealed to us, that unleſs we from our hearts forgive every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes, our Heavenly Father will not forgive us our Treſpaſſes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this attentively, and thou canſt not but perceive the great unreaſonableneſs and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Revenge. Think ſeriouſly how much thou dependeſt upon the Mercy of God for thy Salvation, and then thou wilt not fail to be merciful to thy Brethren. Finally, ſee what an infinite multitude of ſins muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee by God, if thou eſcapeſt Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thou wilt find great cauſe to paſs<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98258:137"/>by without the leaſt thoughts of Revenge, all the Injuries and Wrongs, that can poſſibly be done thee by thy Fellow-Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And many more uſeful Doctrines may we find couch'd under theſe Figurative Speeches and Parables which our Saviour delivered. Thus by the Parable of the Tares permitted to grow amongſt the Wheat, he intimated the Toleration of Diſſenting Opinions, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Piety, or Civil Societies. By the three Parables, Of the Seed growing inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of the grain of Muſtard-ſeed growing up to a Tree, and of a little Leven qualifying the whole Lump; he ſignified the increaſe of the Goſpel, and the Bleſſing of God upon the Apoſtolical Sermons. By the Parable of the Sower ſcattering his Seed by the way-ſide, ſome on ſtony, ſome on thorny, and ſome on good Ground, he intimated the ſeveral Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Indiſpoſitions of mens hearts, the careleſneſs of ſome, the frowardneſs and levity of others, the eaſineſs and ſoftneſs of a third; and how they are ſpoil'd with World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Cares, and how many ways there are to miſcarry, and that but one ſort of Men receive the Word, and bring forth the Fruits of an Holy Life. Thus plentifully did the Saviour of Souls provide for the winning of mens hearts, or elſe (if they were Stubborn and Contumacious, and would not be wrought upon) for the hardening of them, by ſuch pleaſing Diſcourſes; which to purſue in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, were endleſs; for, <hi>Without a Parable ſpake he not unto them.</hi>

How well does a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier fight ſeeing the Courage of his General! How well the Subject in the ſight of his King, that is ready to loſe his Life for him! The Diſciple is not to be above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord. The Son is not to fare better than his Father, nor the Creature better than his Creator. Embarque thy ſelf in the vaſt Gulf of thy Saviour's Paſſion. In that Stormy Sea of his Sufferings thou wilt ſail more ſafely, than in the Haven of thine own Will; for this is hazard, and that Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I had rather endure Torments with my dear Lord, than enjoy the Delights and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World; I had rather follow him and ſerve him on Mount

Love the Croſs, not only in<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98258:138"/>flying from evil, but in following that which is beſt. Pains and Sufferings, Lord, are the Portions of this Life, for Joys we may well wait till the eternal. O what were thy Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, my ſweeteſt Jeſus! If once thou gaveſt liberty to thy Divinity to ſwallow up thy holy Humanity in Glory at thy Transfiguration, how often didſt thou hide it under thy Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; nay, rather thou madeſt uſe of it, that the Sufferings of thy holy Humanity might be the greater, the ſtronger, and the more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Thou with the Power of thy Godhead didſt ſupport the frailty of thy Manhood, and thy Divine Nature gave ſtrength to thy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to the end, that it might thereby be enabled to undergo that, which otherwiſe it could not poſſibly have endured. Conſider then and lament, and follow him in this firſt part of his holy and dolorous Paſſion. When the Eternal Word being prepar'd to Suffer, ask'd leave of his Eternal Father to enter into that Sea of Torments, to compleat the exceſs of his love to Man, and to crown that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience wherewith he diſpos'd himſelf for the Redemption of Mankind, Behold, from Six a Clock in the Evening of that Thurſday (which alſo may well be called Holy) the many painful ſteps, which our Saviour took, in going to ſhed his Blood, and how that moſt gentle Lamb was carried, and offered up by Love for a Sacrifice upon the Croſs.</p>
                     <p>There the Prophecy of Venerable <hi>Simeon</hi> had its perfect completion; there the ſharp<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98258:138"/>Sword of Sorrow pierced through the heart of his Virgin-Mother.

Yield an humble reſignation to the Judgments of the Lord, and chearfully bear whatſoever he ſhall ordain concerning thee, ſince thou ſeeſt the Son of God and his Mother; the one giving up his Blood to obey it, and the other her Heart. Refuſe not Labours, repay not Slanders, reſiſt not Perſecutions and Affronts, but whatſoever thou ſhalt ſuffer, ſuffer it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and patiently for the ſake of that deareſt Lord. God the Father ſends them, God the Son in bearing teaches thee to bear them, and God the Holy Ghoſt will give thee Comfort in them.</p>

That which is God's permiſſion in him that ſins, is his diſpenſation to him that ſuffers; and thoſe very Afflictions and Perſecutions which God permits by a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, he makes uſe of as the Chiſel and Mallet, with which he is cutting out and forming of a Martyr. He commands the one to ſuffer, and ſuffers the other to torment; to the one he<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98258:139"/>ſends a Crown of Martyrdom from Heaven, and leaves the other upon Earth to commit Sins, which will be his everlaſting Torment in Hell; therefore whatſoever thou ſhalt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, bear it patiently in God, with God, and for God.</p>

                     <head>Of the Laſt Supper, and of the waſhing of his Diſciples Feet.</head>
                     <p>Now behold the Lord Jeſus with all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles entring into the Chamber prepared for them to celebrate the Legal, Natural, and Euchariſtical Suppers in, where the Eternal Shepherd made himſelf Food, for the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of his Sheep. Behold, how with his Diſciples he celebrates the Ancient Legal Paſſover, with Staves in their hands ſtanding, with Shoes on his holy feet, eating thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Herbs which he aboliſhed, and leaving them for the ſweet Aliment and Suſtenance, he after gave us in his moſt Holy Body and Blood. With that he gave a full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Ancient Written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and gave it a Farewel with his moſt holy Hand, ſhutting the Door for ever againſt thoſe Ceremonies, which till then were enjoyn'd, but are ſince ſeal'd up and prohibited.</p>
                     <p>Having ended that firſt Supper of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb, (which was much more a Figure, and a Myſtery, than a Nouriſhment) his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles celebrated the natural and common Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, giving refreſhment to their weary Limbs,<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98258:139"/>that their Nature might be enabled to ſupport thoſe Injuries, Pains, and Torments, which Sin was like to bring upon them. In that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Supper our Saviour gives <hi>Judas</hi> an hint of his intended Treaſon, and of his own Mercy; and as if he had meant to awaken him from his wicked Lethargy, offers him the Sop he had dipped, to the end that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor changing the colour of the Bread, might check the Traitor with the thought of his moſt precious Blood, and that he was going to ſhed it, even for him, by being nail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs. Our Lord ſtrikes a trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his Diſciples, by affirming that one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them would betray him.
<hi>Peter</hi> loving him fervently, and being ſtout, deſires to be informed by the means of <hi>John,</hi> who that Traiterous Diſciple was, that (as it is credible) he might chaſtiſe ſo horrid a wickedneſs; but our Lord, who that Night had made, as it were, an Embargo upon all Pains and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeized them only for himſelf, would not plainly manifeſt the Traitor, leſt by diſcovering ſo horrible a Treachery, the Salvation and Redemption of Mankind ſhould have been hindred.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe two Suppers being ended, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to eſtabliſh Humility in the hearts of his Diſciples, to the end that by increaſing and multiplying, it might be derived to the whole Church of God, enriching and improving it with that Holy Vertue; The Creator riſes to waſh the feet of his Creatures, and who could<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98258:140"/>cleanſe them better, than he that Created them? Who could better repair what was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down, than he that made the Building? Who could better reſtore us to our former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, than he that was like us in all things, Sin only excepted? Who could waſh and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our Sins, but the Author and Fountain of Grace? which flowing in the Heart of our Lord moſt full of Mercy, that Source of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goodneſs pours it forth with his moſt Holy Hand; for, From what other Hand could ſo great pity and compaſſion have proceeded?</p>
                     <p>What other Water, O Jeſus my Redeemer, could cleanſe the foulneſs of my Sins? What other but thy Divine Hands could purifie the Defilements of my inordinate Paſſions? What but Innocency itſelf could whiten the ſtains of my polluted Soul? What could take away my Wickedneſs, but thy Infinite and Unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goodneſs?</p>
                     <p>He begins to waſh the Feet of his Apoſtles, of which ſome think the firſt were the fouleſt and the moſt diſloyal, that ever trod upon the Ground; beginning as the Divine Phyſician with
<hi>Judas,</hi> who had the moſt deadly Diſeaſe, and haſtening the Remedy to him firſt, that was in the greateſt danger. Others, who would have St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be Head of the Church, ſay, He began with him; That Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being the beſt grounded, and the moſt powerful, which begins from the higheſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the Head unto the reſt of the Body. That holy Apoſtle ſeeing his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98258:140"/>at his Feet, was humbled and confounded before he touched them. He that had walked upon the Waters, and Trampled upon the Waves, ſinks deeper in this Baſon, through Love, than he had done in the depth of the Sea through Fear. Seeing an Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſo beyond all meaſure, and that his God was down upon his Knees at his Feet, he was in ſuch an amazement, that he denied them him, ſaying,
<hi>Lord, thou ſhalt not waſh my feet.</hi> O what an high acknowledgment was this of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Lord, wilt thou waſh my feet?</hi> It was in its kind, an higher one than when he confeſſed him near <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> He then knew him, and confeſſed him to be God, but he did not know himſelf; but now <hi>Peter</hi> acknowledges him to be God, Infinite and Omnipotent, and himſelf to be a wretched weak Man, and a moſt miſerable Sinner. Many pretend to know God, and are ignorant of themſelves; but they know him indeed, who by his Divine Light, come to diſcover their own Darkneſs. <hi>Lord, wilt thou waſh my feet?</hi> Thou, the God of Heaven, and I a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Duſt of the Earth? Thou the Creator, and I the vileſt of all Creatures? Thou, the Eternal Greatneſs of the Creation, the Soul of all that lives; and I the fraileſt, the meaneſt of all that Die? Thou my Maſter, and I thy Diſciple? Thou, the King and Crown of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and I a poor ſimple Fiſherman; nay, which is worſe, a ſinful Worm, and therefore more baſe, than any of thoſe that crawl upon<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98258:141"/>the Ground? Thou, that art Innocency adn Goodneſs itſelf, upon thy Knees at the Feet of my Sins, and of my Wickedneſs? Finally, O my Jeſus, Thou, who art greater than the greateſt, doſt thou kneel at my Feet, who am leſs than the leaſt of thy Mercies?</p>
                     <p>Thus the Humility of that loving Diſciple oppoſed that of his Maſter with a Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, while all ſtood looking and admiring, to behold which would get the Victory, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Human nature knowing the infinite height of the Divine, or the Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infinite Miſery of the Humane. It ſeems more juſt, that here <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have overcome God, than God <hi>Peter,</hi> as it is more reaſonable that Man ſhould ſerve God, than that God ſhould ſerve Man. It is the part of Man to obey, and of God to command; to Man it belongs to Serve, and to God, to ſuffer himſelf to be Served, Loved, and Adored.</p>
                     <p>This indeed was a Myſtery of Love and Divine Charity, and he ſhewed this exceſſive kindneſs, to oblige and to enflame theirs to him, and to one another by his example; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If I being your Maſter and your Lord, have waſhed your Feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one anothers Feet. That Love, which made him being God to become Man, made him being Man, to humble himſelf before Man. And that Sovereign Lord never took a righter courſe for that high intent, than by humbling and proſtrating himſelf, to waſh, to cleanſe, and to purifie Man. He made himſelf Man,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98258:141"/>that he might redeem him; and did it ſeem much for God being become Man, to kneel down to waſh him?</p>
                     <p>Yes, dear Jeſus, it is much, much beyond expreſſion, for nothing of all this could be deſerved by Man. He does not deſerve any remedy, becauſe he has been the Author of his own Miſery, but thy unbounded, thy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compaſſion looks upon his Neceſſity, and not upon his Demerits. Whither, dear Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhall the high expreſſions of thy Love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend? Where ſhall this Infinite Charity of thine be limited? Behold Lord, we are Men, that is to ſay, meer Miſery and Wickedneſs. Behold, Lord, thou art God, that is to ſay, the moſt Sovereign Power, and Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Doſt thou ſo far abaſe thy Divinity, as to drag it upon the Earth within thy Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Is it not enough for thee to make thy ſelf Man, unleſs thou humbleſt and proſtrateſt thy ſelf before Man? Who can ſee God at his feet without falling into an Extaſy of Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and without giving up his life, through an exceſſive Humility? Who can chooſe but die with ſhame and confuſion, to ſee ſo unfitting an in-equality? I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> reſiſted it, for beſides that, he knew that his Maſter was God, and he a vile Creature, he loved his God, and he loved his Maſter extreamly much, and in the ſame proportion that he loved him, was the trouble he felt to ſee him kneeling at his feet; ſince he knew that it was the duty of all earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98258:142"/>to ſerve and adore him. But yet for all that, <hi>Peter</hi> at laſt yielded to Chriſt, it being moſt juſt that man ſhould yield to God, ſince the greateſt Humility lies in the greateſt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the Diſciple therefore muſt obey his Maſter, and the Servant his Lord. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told him, that if he would not be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and purified, he could have no ſhare in his Redemption; at the hearing of which terrible Sentence, <hi>Peter</hi> offered him not only his feet to be waſhed, but his Hands and his Head al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. To this Chriſt replyed. He that is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, needeth not ſave only to waſh his Feet but is clean all over: That is, he that hath been already waſhed in the Laver of Baptiſm, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to waſh the Feet of his Affections, which from the Earth and miſery of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Paſſions riſe up to the Heart. Hereby the Redeemer of Souls ſignifies that Purity, wherewith we ought to prepare our ſelves for the receiving of the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for before he Conſecrates that, he in the waſhing his Diſciples feet, gives them an example of Humility and Reſignation, and in the Water expreſſes the vertue of thoſe peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Tears, wherewith they were to waſh their Sins, and bewail their Miſeries. And by not ſuffering the Duſt of the Earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon their Feet, teaches them that they ſhould much leſs ſuffer inordinate Affections to remain in their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:98258:142"/>In ſhort our Bleſſed Lord waſhed the feet of all the Holy Apoſtles, and amongſt the reſt, thoſe of the Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe cruel Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy was ſo great, that neither the touching them with thoſe Divine Hands, nor the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo near to the Compaſſionate Breaſt of the Redeemer of Souls could mollifie the hardneſs of his Heart, nor change the cruelty of his Intention. O how hard-hearted a thing is Covetouſneſs! What an inſenſible Rock! How well does St. <hi>Paul</hi> call it the Source of all evil? O what a difficult thing it is to bring thoſe with ſincerity home to God, who once have loſt their reſpect to him ſo far, as to dare to offend him to his Face. Let ſo many Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners, ſo many Harlots, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked Livers ſpeak this, who repenting were pardoned, and the Traiterous Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Judas,</hi> who perſiſting in Impenitency was Damned.</p>

                     <p>After that our Sovereign Lord and Maſter had Conſecrated the Elements of Bread and Wine, breaking the one and giving it them to Eat, and pouring out the other, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98258:144"/>all to Drink, calling the one his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the other his Blood, and thereby changing not their nature, but their uſe, that they might become a Sacrament, which ſhould remain in his Church, not only for a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his precious Death and Paſſion, but alſo for a Conveyance of the Merits thereof, for the Remiſſion of Sins. He Conſecrated alſo the Apoſtles themſelves, and gave them the Power and Vertue to Conſecrate and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others, and to ſend them forth, as he did them for the Propagation of his Goſpel, and for the Adminiſtration and Government of Souls. This was another admirable expreſſion of the Love of our Lord Jeſus to Mankind, ſince whereas he could have taken upon him the nature of Angels, and left them Heirs of that rich Poſſeſſion of Receiving, Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Adminiſtring thoſe precious Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, he was pleaſed to beſtow that Benefit and Priviledge upon Mankind, which thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Honour and Favour, as well as Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But, Lord, I wonder not at that, ſince from the time thou madeſt thy ſelf Man, all advantages were brought to Man, by joyning thy Divinity to his Humanity.</p>
                     <p>O that, as thou haſt given to us Biſhops and Prieſts this Dignity, we had alſo the Spirit, the Devotion, and the Piety of the Apoſtles! And, Lord, as the Power thou haſt conferr'd upon us, is what thou haſt not granted to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and to Seraphins, O that the Perfection of our Manners, and the Purity and Charity of<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98258:144"/>our Souls were in ſome degree ſuitable to that of Angels, and of Seraphins! But, O God, we have a Dignity of great weight upon very weak ſhoulders; the Dignity is fit for Angels, the Weakneſs is of miſerable Sinners; And thou only, O Eternal Goodneſs; thy Mercy, and thy Strength alone can help and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſupport our Weakneſs and Miſery. Since then, O ſweet Lord, thou giveſt us this Dignity, give us alſo thoſe parts and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are expedient for it. Since thou haſt given us the Obligations, help us alſo with the Abilities; ſince thou giveſt us the Miniſtry, give us alſo the Spirit. As thou haſt made us to repreſent thee, make us alſo to imitate thee. As thou haſt given us the Power, give us alſo the Vertue with the Power. Suffer us not, O Divine Goodneſs, to ſerve in that High Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Uncharitableneſs and Indignity. If thou wilt not help the Biſhops, the Fathers of the Faith, and the Shepherds of Souls, O thou Eternal lover of Souls, whom wilt thou help? If our Light muſt enlighten the Souls of others, what ſhall become both of us and others, if we want thy Light? Thou calleſt the Apoſtles and Miniſters the Salt of the Earth, and if the Salt loſe its ſavour, how ſhall their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be ſeaſoned? <hi>If the blind lead the blind, ſhall they not both fall into the ditch?</hi> Grant, O Lord, that thy Goodneſs and thy Love may dwell in us, that thy Mercy and thy Charity may burn in our hearts, and that the fire of thy Divine Love may break forth from thence to kindle<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98258:145"/>and enflame the hearts of our Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                     <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having Conſecrated his Holy Apoſtles to be Teachers of the Faith, and Pillars of his Church; and having made himſelf their Miniſter and their Prieſt, enters into the breaſts of thoſe that were to be his Miniſters and Prieſts, to become an unbloody Sacrifice in the Altar of thoſe living Temples, before he was a bloody one upon the Altar of the Croſs. They with profound Reverence receive the Lord, whom they adore and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in receiving him, and at the ſame time feel within themſelves him that miniſters unto them; and two fires becoming but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them, that without by their Eyes, and that within by their Hearts. That happy Night the Lord took poſſeſſion of the breaſt and heart of Men, and they in exchange took a Proof of the exceſſive Love of God; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour likewiſe had a Proof of Man's Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſince the Traitor
<hi>Judas</hi> received him; his infinite Charity being reſolv'd to try, if he could poſſibly be waſhed clean within, who was not purified at all by his having been waſhed without: But he, that had kept his foul Intention notwithſtanding the waſhing of his Feet, and would not make uſe of that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to waſh his evil Eye, was as little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the inward waſhing, for he ſhut his Eyes againſt that Beam, which would have enlightened him, and the fire of his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was more powerful than the fire of ſo<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98258:145"/>great a Charity. He ſuffered his Redeemer to come into his breaſt, not that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, but that he might the better ſell him, and ſo he carried him along with him, that he might not get away, when he was to deliver him up in the Garden. At the ſame inſtant that he received the Saviour of Souls into his covetous Breaſt, he preſently went out to ſell him to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereby it appears that he received him, to the end that he might betray him more ſecurely that way, than by leaving him behind. And this was the firſt and moſt grievous ſtep of his Paſſion, to be received by that Treacherous Diſciple. O let us, that are Prieſts, tremble in Receiving and Adminiſtring the Sacrament of him, who in loving us enters as a meek and a gentle Lamb into our breaſt, and who, when he comes to Judge us, will be a fierce Lion, if we receive him here unworthily.</p>

                  <p>THeſe three unſpeakable Myſteries being ended, the Saviour of Souls goes forth into the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> to give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to his dolorous Paſſion, that the place where the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> rais'd us up, might be like that, where the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> caſt us down. It was in a Garden we were ruined by the firſt of Men, and in another Garden we were repair'd by the beſt of Men. There our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer ſweats drops of Blood for the purging of thy ſins and mine; ſo laborious was it to bear the weight of our ſins, that his holy Pores were thereby opened, and even Innocency itſelf was put into an Agony by that intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burden. There to ſee the Ingratitude of Mankind, and how much they would deſpiſe the un-utterable Treaſures of Man's Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made blood break forth from the Body of the King of Heaven, and run trickling down to the very Earth. There he thrice made earneſt Prayer unto his Father for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for us; asking ſtrength of Body for himſelf, and ſtrength of Soul for us. There<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98258:146"/>he repeated his Prayer ſo often, to teach us, that our Prayer ought to be earneſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering. The Humane Nature begg'd aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Divine; and he weighed the heavineſs, and ſhrunk from the bitterneſs of that Cup, that his Divinity might help his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in the drinking of it. There our dear Maſter by ſuffering taught us to ſuffer; that our Patience and Courage in Suffering depends wholly upon God, and that there is nothing in us but Miſeries; as if he ſhould have ſaid, If I, who am God as well as Man, do as Man need the ſuccour and favour of God, and ask it with a threefold repetition; Why do not ye, weak, wretched, and miſerable Men ask it a thouſand times, and why are ye not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, devout, and fervent in your Prayers?</p>
                  <p>He there alſo granted, that the Cup of his grievous Paſſion ſhould paſs on to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and that they, and from them the reſt of his Church, ſhould inherit that Patrimony of Pains, and that effectual Medicine of Sins. <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> ſays he to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as if his meaning had been, Grant, O my God and Father, that theſe my Apoſtles, and all thoſe that by the Preaching of them and their Succeſſors ſhall heartily receive and embrace my Religion, may drink of this Cup with me, that they may alſo Reign with me.

In ſerving thee, dear Jeſus, we are dull and ſleepy; in offending thee we are lively and watchful. Who could bear with ſuch Wickedneſs, but only thy infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Who but thou, O moſt Gracious Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, could endure ſuch ſleepineſs, and ſuch watchfulneſs; ſuch watchfulneſs in Sin, and ſuch ſleepineſs in Love?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> being Treacherous and Covetous, for a little Money ſells the Eternal Son of God, and makes them pay for him, to whom he freely offers himſelf in Gift. Thoſe infamous Miniſters of Covetouſneſs and Envy come with great force of Arms to lay hold of a gentle Lamb; and Humane Weakneſs attempts with Cords to bind the Divine Omnipotence. But what great matter was it, that he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be bound by their wickedneſs, when he had already bound himſelf with his own Charity? That Treacherous Diſciple with infamous lips kiſſes his Face, and turns the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Peace into a Signal of the greateſt Treachery. The Lord calls him Friend, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was ſo cruel an Enemy, and ſtill bore with him, and loved him, becauſe he ſuffered himſelf to be ſold for Love. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to try, if it were poſſible, to ſoften
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98258:147"/>the heart that was ſo hardened in miſchief; but his heart being in his Purſe, he neither would, nor could let it be wrought upon by the meekneſs of his Maſter. St. <hi>Peter</hi> being both fervent and valiant, at the taking of our Redeemer cuts off an Ear of one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (and it is probable he would have done the like to <hi>Judas,</hi> if he had been near him) but the moſt ſweet and merciful Jeſus reſtores it, reproving that loving Diſciple; and being able with his Divinity to have defended his Humanity, he makes uſe of the one to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the other, by a clearer demonſtration diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his Divinity in the Miracle, and his Humanity in the Advice and Remedy. O more than infinite Goodneſs! O thy merciful forwardneſs to Pardon and to Suffer! Thou reproveſt him that defends thee, and cureſt him that offends, and comes to take thee. Yet in that hurry and diſorder of wickedneſs the Miracle was not taken notice of, and it being a Night of ſo much darkneſs, to what could it prompt the minds of Men, but to what was black and cruel?</p>
                  <p>Now they bring the Bleſſed Jeſus thus tied and bound at Midnight to the Houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> who was the Father-in-law of
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Prieſt, and there without Right or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without Juſtice or Mercy, the Univerſal Judge of Souls is examined, as a guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He gives them a modeſt holy Anſwer, for which they give him a box on the Ear, the whole Heaven weeping at that time to ſee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98258:148"/>ſo horrid a Crime committed upon Earth. From that day Affronts became honourable, Ignominy glorious, and that began to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, which before had been Contempt. The Croſs had been accounted ſhameful, till the unſpeakable Myſteries of Man's Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were celebrated upon it; but from the time that God bleſſed and conſecrated Pains and Puniſhments with his Pains and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be Merry began to be a great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to Suffer was made to be a great Honour.</p>
                  <p>While our Lord ſuffered theſe things in the Houſe of
<hi>Annas,</hi> the Officers and People ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves together in the Houſe of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and they led the moſt meek and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus before him, becauſe he was the High-Prieſt for that Year, and ſo the Lamb was brought before a Council of Lions, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolves. There Envy Examines him, Injuſtice Condemns him, and the Blaſphemers of God pronounce God himſelf to be a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer. O Folly, that exceeds all Folly! O Wickedneſs, that ſurpaſſes all Wickedneſs! Man condemns God for a Blaſphemer, when the greateſt Blaſphemy, that Man's Nature could commit, was to declare ſo fooliſh a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſo Blaſphemous a Sentence.</p>
                  <p>But while they are condemning our Bleſſed Lord, his Divine Majeſty ſuffers no leſs by the Denial of his Loving Diſciple, than by the Perſecution of his bitter Enemies; but his merciful Eyes raiſe him up again, ſince it was<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98258:148"/>the fall of a Lover, who came to ſeek for his Beloved. St. <hi>Peter</hi> fell, where no body elſe durſt come; His fall was by the frailty of our Nature, but his coming thither, when all the reſt forſook their Maſter and fled, was by the Valour of Grace. It was not ſo with the Impenitent <hi>Judas,</hi> who, beſides his being a Covetous Traitor, was alſo diſtruſtful of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for he having made Reſtitution of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Money, did with a worſe kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſeek his Remedy in Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Behold Jeſus being condemn'd to Death by the <hi>Jew,</hi> they deliver him up to the <hi>Gentile;</hi> and having loaded him with Injuries, Affronts, Buffetings, and a thouſand other ſorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they preſent him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> By him he is examined again, and the Idolater leſs partial acknowledges the Malice of the Sons of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Vertue and Holineſs of the Son of God. Yet what does that help, if Envy and Cruelty be more powerful in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, than Truth and Innocency in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending? But to the end that the pains of our Redeemer might be the greater, he finds him very ſlack and remiſs in his Defence, and them very fierce, vigorous, and conſtant in his Proſecution; but at laſt the violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Accuſer always gets the better of a weak and unconcern'd Judge; ſo <hi>Pilate,</hi> not to give himſelf the trouble of defending Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, delivers it up bound into the hands of Malice; yet having ſome little ſcruple to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo great a wickedneſs, he would fain have<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98258:149"/>ſhuffled it off to another, and remits him to <hi>Herod,</hi> to ſee if he could eaſe himſelf of ſo troubleſome a Cauſe, and avoid ſo foul a Crime as that which thoſe fierce Tygers would have had him to commit.</p>
                  <p>They bring the Saviour of Souls to the Houſe of
<hi>Herod,</hi> and that ſenſual Inceſtuous King would have had him to work ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for his Diverſion, not having been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe thoſe he had wrought for his Salvation. Our Bleſſed Lord gives him no Anſwer, for he that had beheaded <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and ſilenced the voice of his Holy Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, did not deſerve to hear the voice of the Eternal Word. In the end, the Eternal Wiſdom being deſpiſed as a Fool,
<hi>Herod</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to be the Judge of his Cauſe, and ſo being cloathed in a Robe of Scorn, they bring him back again to <hi>Pilate.</hi> Thither the cruel Multitude follow him with their Clamours, and being impatient to ſee Injuſtice ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Condemn Innocency, they with loud cries entreat the <hi>Gentile,</hi> that he might be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, becauſe the Superſtitious <hi>Jew</hi> would not defile himſelf by his death in the time of the Paſſover, thinking that provided he kept but an outward Purity, it was no matter though he had a thouſand Impurities and bloody ſtains in his Soul. How well did our Saviour tell them, that they were Cups waſhed clean on the outſide, but that within they were full of Riot and Exceſs; and whited Sepulchres, whoſe inſide was full of Rottenneſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption!<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98258:149"/>The Preſident makes ſtill ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and for an expedient of Pity Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Holy Jeſus to be ſcourged, believing that at the ſight of his Scourging and Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Thorns, his fierce Accuſers would be ſoftened and ſatisfied. O Pity, more cruel than Cruelty itſelf! Are five thouſand laſhes a merciful means to ſave the Innocent? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, O my Soul, what ſort of Compaſſion was uſed in the dolorous Paſſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Souls, ſince they took it for a kind of Pity to tear his Fleſh with ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Stripes, and how juſtly it is ſaid, <hi>That the mercies of the wicked are cruel!</hi> Thus ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Rivers of Blood, crowned with Thorns, having put a Reed in his hand, and an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Robe of Purple on his back, he brings forth the Lord Jeſus to be ſeen by that ungrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful People, bidding them <hi>behold the man;</hi> but they ſtill fierce and barbarous, cry out to have him crucified. How ſoft are Rocks, how gentle are Lions and Tygers in compariſon of ſuch Monſters! Behold our Savage hardneſs, ſince God ſuffers in this manner for Man, and Man ſtill continues cruel and obdurate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God! Is it poſſible that ſo many wounds and ſufferings ſhould not work upon them? nor at all abate their fury? Is it poſſible ſo doleful, ſo miſerable a Spectacle ſhould not ſoften Humane hearts? There is no Anger, no Rage, nor Fury ſo violent againſt a Criminal, which does not relent to ſome tenderneſs at the ſight of his Puniſhment; but here at the<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98258:150"/>ſight of Innocency itſelf tormented, abuſed, and affronted with all kinds of Mockery and Deriſion, they become more hardened, more furious, and more enraged. Sure they were Statues of Braſs, ſince all this could not move them; or if they had the fleſh, at leaſt it was impoſſible they ſhould have the hearts of Men. But, O Lord, how much more reaſon have we to condemn our ſelves! For if our ſinful and obdurate Souls are not chang'd and ſoften'd by thy Pains and Sufferings, believing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing thee; what wonder is it, if thoſe cruel Murtherers perſiſted in their bloody purpoſe, ſince they denied and rejected thee? The Preſident ſeeing that his Expedient had been fruitleſs, and that the People were grown but the more furious by it, condemns him to Death, (though diſſwaded by his Wife upon her Dream from having any thing to do with that Juſt Perſon) and delivers him to them to be crucified; ſince all that was eaſier for ſuch a mean complying Judge to conſent to, than to trouble and hazard himſelf in the further Defence of Innocency. Yet that he might remain clear and ſpotleſs, and honoured in the Opinion of the World, in Condemning our Saviour he declares himſelf not guilty of his Blood, and ſo he waſhes his hands, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf with laying the Crime upon others. But what greater Infamy can a Judge be guilty of, than to ſuffer the Accuſers themſelves to write and to ſign the Sentence?</p>

                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:98258:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>This being done, our Bleſſed Saviour car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Croſs alone for a great part of the way to Mount
<hi>Calvary,</hi> and becauſe they thought the time long of his getting thither, they make <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> help him to bear it, that he might be there ſo much the ſooner; for it was not out of pity that they gave him that Aſſiſtance, but it was an effect of their Cruelty; nor did they intend it for any eaſe to his Life, but for the haſtening of his Death. In his way to <hi>Calvary</hi> he is bewailed by the Daughters of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> leaving this Glory to the Women, that they alone wept at the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Lord, their Maſter, and their Redeemer. They ſtrip his Body for the cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Souls, and at the ſame time both Heaven and Earth were cloathed with Grief and Darkneſs to mourn for the Sufferings of their Creator. They with rough hard Nails faſten the Eternal Son of God unto the Croſs, the Ingratitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> making him that requital for all his Divine Benefits. Thoſe bleſſed Feet, that travelled up and down ſo many weary ſteps, to ſeek Sinners, that he might ſave and pardon them; Thoſe liberal Hands, full of Charity and Beneficence, are bored through, and nailed by thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom he came to ſuccour. Not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a good turn, is Ingratitude and Wickedneſs; what ſhall it then be to pierce both the Hands and Feet of ones Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor?</p>

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:98258:151"/>Then they raiſe up the Bleſſed Jeſus upon the Croſs, and allow him the Superiority over two Thieves, as fit Subjects for the King of that Royal Throne; and by the ſame action they raiſe and exalt Man's Nature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it in a manner to be Divine.
<hi>When the Son of Man ſhall be raiſed up</hi> (ſaid his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty) <hi>he will draw all along with him.</hi> It is clear he did ſo, ſince by his moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood he waſhed and redeemed them, and with his moſt ardent Love he called and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed them. O my deareſt Lord God, who wert wounded and deſpiſed, crucified and crowned with Thorns, and for my ſins didſt ſuffer ſo many torments upon the Croſs; I beſeech thee by the Merits of them all, O ſweeteſt Jeſus, to pardon all my grievous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. Since thou haſt drawn up all, draw me up alſo, O moſt Gracious Saviour. Do not ſuffer that moſt precious Blood to leave unwaſhed this Soul, which confeſſes thee, and acknowledges thee to be God. Thy ardent Charity interceded to thy Father for thoſe very Enemies that crucified thee; How much rather then wilt thou be the Mediator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of a poor Chriſtian, who confeſſes and adores thy Sovereign Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>Behold, admire, and adore thy Suffering Saviour, and bewail thy ſins the cauſe of all his Sufferings. Behold all Creatures in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee their Creator in ſo woful a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Behold the Heavens obſcur'd at that Eclipſe of his Heavenly Beauties! Behold the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98258:151"/>Earth and all the Elements confounded at the awfulneſs of his Pains and Torments! Behold how the Sun withdraws its Light, not to ſee ſo horrid a Wickedneſs, and ſo terrible an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude! Behold even the very Rocks ſo ſoftened, as to cleave aſunder in compaſſion! What kind of hearts then are thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſenſible? Lord, ſuffer not mine to be one of them, but let it melt with Love and Contrition, to think of thy heavy Torments, and of my hainous Offences. The Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, and ſhall my Heart be whole? Shall not my Breaſt and all my Bowels open themſelves to receive the Blood which thou ſheddeſt for my Redemption?</p>
                  <p>Behold the Holy Virgin at the Foot of her Son's Croſs, who recommends her to the care of his beloved Diſciple. Behold, how one drop of his Blood falling upon the good Thief, was to him the Baptiſm of Life; and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the Bad, who knew not how to make his advantage of it. He there made the Divine Nature propitious to the Human, that it might be pardoned, and by the laſt of thoſe ſeven Words which he ſpake upon the Croſs, declar'd that by his Blood and Death he had finiſhed the Work of our Redemption. Then after having hung three Hours alive upon the Croſs, He that was the Life of Souls, gave them Life by his Death, and a Life eternal, which Triumphs over Death for ever. When he was dead, the Souldier with a Spear pierced his moſt holy Side, out of which came Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98258:152"/>and Blood, repreſenting the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and making a wide Door for holy Souls to enter; and after other three Hours, the Piety of his Friends takes him down from the Croſs, laying his precious Body in a new Sepulchre, which was beſtowed on him by the Charity of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> So he, who during his Life had not a Houſe to reſt his Head in, was ſo poor likewiſe at his Death, that he had not ſo much as a Grave of his own, to put his Body in. There they ſadly lament his loſs, and burying him in their Hearts, as they had done in that Tomb, they leave him there embalmed with Spices, that, as it was Propheſied of him, he might be as the Rich in his Death; and though there they leave him, yet they carry him away with them in their remembrance, that we by their example never may forget him.</p>
                  <p>After his ſad and bloody Paſſion, ſucceeded his Powerful Reſurrection, when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Hell, as well as Death, and then the Glorious Triumph of his Aſcenſion, to the end, that Human Nature might not only be Redeemed, but alſo Honoured and Crowned; yet before he went up into Heaven, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his Mother and the Apoſtles, to whom he ſeveral times appeared after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end that their Joy for it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe the Sadneſs they had felt at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Paſſion. He examined St. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice concerning his Love, that by three Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he might purge away the Shame of his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98258:152"/>three Denials, bidding him as often to feed his Lambs. He ſignified to him by what death he ſhould Glorifie God, commanding them all to Preach the Goſpel, and aſſuring them, that he would be with them to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>Within few days after he made good his promiſe in ſending them another Comforter, for at <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon the Apoſtles in fiery Tongues, to the end, that the third Perſon in the Holy Trinity might Govern the Church, which the ſecond had founded in his Blood, and which the firſt ſtill ſupports with abundance of Coeleſtial Bleſſings. This is a Week, which is ſufficient to employ all our Days, and Weeks, and Years, even to Eternity; in imitating thoſe Vertues, in adoring thoſe Myſteries, and in for ever prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Saviour and Redeemer of Souls, who performed them for our ſakes.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Exerciſe of the three Theological Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, upon Contemplation of the Life and Death of our Saviour.</head>
                  <p>WE have been furniſhed with large mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſideration, which not only is ſweet and holy, but alſo moſt profitable to our Souls. For the Life of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the Looking-glaſs of our Lives: His Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt baniſh the Sins and Paſſions of our Hearts. His Sufferings muſt moderate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Pleaſures. His Wounds muſt be the Cure of our Wounds and Maladies. His Croſs muſt be our Banner, and his Death our Life. From hence, as from a moſt clear and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Original, thou art to Copy out thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are to reſiſt, aſſault, and conquer thy Vices. Upon theſe high and Heavenly Myſteries, thou art to fix thy Faith, thy Hope, and thy Love at all times. So far as thou ſhalt think and meditate upon the Life and Paſſion of our Lord, ſo far will thy Faith quicken and enliven thee; and that Faith, which being Dead and without Works, will<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98258:153"/>be but the cauſe of thy greater Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by being made a living and a working Faith will obtain for thee a high Reward. If you have Faith, ſayes our Saviour, you ſhall remove Mountains. O how great is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Faith? If you have Faith, ask of me and you ſhall receive, ſeek me, and you ſhall find me; and if you knock, it ſhall be opened unto you.</p>
                  <p>That lively Faith, which is offered and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in the Life and Death of the Saviour of Souls, is not only to believe what Faith teaches us, but alſo to do in the ſame meaſure as we believe. To believe ſo many Heavenly Myſteries, and not to act in conformity to them, is a very imperfect Faith. To believe a God will not ſerve the turn alone; The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> believe and tremble too, and yet are now burning in Hell. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knows very well, that God is God, and abhors him, though he believes. Doſt thou believe in God, art thou a Chriſtian? Tis well. But tell me how many are Condemned for ever, who believed but did not do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Doſt thou believe in Chriſt, and yet wilt not follow Chriſt, and which is worſe, doſt thou Perſecute him, and Crucifie him again by thy wicked Life? Woe be to thee! and woe be to me! if we thus believe in Chriſt. This People (ſaith he) honour me with their Lips, but their Heart is far from me. Woe be to thee and me, if we honour Chriſt on that manner!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:98258:154"/>
                     <hi>Not all thoſe</hi> (ſaith the Holy Jeſus) <hi>that cry unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the will of my Father.</hi> That is to ſay, there are two ſorts of Perſons, that cry Lord, Lord, which are two ſorts of Believers: The one ſay, and do not do; believe, but do not work: The other both ſay and do, believe, and likewiſe work. He that believes and does ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that believes a God, and yet works againſt him, and Offends and Crucifies him, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be admitted into thoſe Heavenly Manſions. 'Tis not enough to do, without believing, nor to believe without doing; both are neceſſary, and we muſt work without giving over. Let every one look and conſider what his works are, for thither he ſhall go, whither his Thoughts, Words, and Actions direct their Courſe. Are they ſinful? Then to Hell. Are they full of Tears, Repentance, and Contrition? Then to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Look what thou ſoweſt, for that ſhalt thou reap. If Corruption, thou ſhalt reap Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; if Perfection, thou ſhalt reap Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Doſt thou ſow Vertues in this Life? Thou ſhalt reap Coeleſtial Crowns in the other. Doſt thou ſow Vices? Thou ſhalt reap Eternal Torments. A lively Faith, I ſay, a lively Faith is that which will ſave us; a lively, active, a pure, holy Faith; not one defil'd with Sins, deformed with Paſſions, and full of Miſery, and Preſumption. Doſt thou live as if thou<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98258:154"/>wert an Heathen, and yet believe thy ſelf a Chriſtian? Unleſs thou amendeſt thy Life, the Heathen ſhall carry the Chriſtian along with him to Hell, but the Chriſtian ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry the Heathen along with him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Doſt thou believe an Eternity, and yet liveſt without any memory of that Eternity, having all thy thoughts faſtened on that which is meerly Temporal? Theſe Tranſitory and Temporal things will paſs away, and then thou ſhalt come to ſuffer Torments in Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Do not deceive thy ſelf, nor think it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe without working, nor that Chriſt's having ſuffered for thee will be enough to ſave thee, whilſt thou ungratefully offendeſt him, that ſuffered for thee. Alas! that will not ſerve the turn, but rather it will be enough and too much to damn thee. Doſt thou think Chriſt came to ſuffer, to the end that thou mighteſt the more freely ſin againſt him? Doſt thou think he came into the World, that thou mighteſt heap up thy wickedneſſes upon his holy ſhoulders? Doſt thou think he came to facilitate thy Crimes? to the end that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinners might compound their Vices with his Merits? Doſt thou think that Heavenly Maſter of Purity and Holineſs came to open a Gate unto all Vice, whereby his Sufferings might ſerve to ſave thoſe, that only believed and wrought nothing but Sins and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? The Eternal Son of God came into the World, not only to Redeem us, but alſo to Teach us; In his Blood he left Redemption, <pb n="282" facs="tcp:98258:155"/>and in his Life, Inſtruction. He underwent his Paſſion to redeem Souls; but his Actions were ſo high and holy, to amend, inform, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and purifie them. The effect of his Pains, his Croſs, his Death, is to give Merit to our Works, and Grace and Force to a Chriſtian to ſuffer with him; but the effect of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Perfections, and whole Life, is to teach us, and to ſet us a Pattern to imitate, as far as we are able. <hi>I have given you an Example,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that ye ſhould do as I have done.</hi> And in another place he ſays, <hi>Whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> He is no perfect Chriſtian, nor is it poſſible he ſhould be, that flies from the Croſs, even though he might eſcape it. Every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to follow, and embrace the Croſs of his Redeemer. Can any Man be a perfect Chriſtian without keeping the Commandments? No, certainly. Why then the keeping of them is to follow Chriſt in taking up his Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that when thou cameſt into the Gate of the Church, by being Baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, thou wert ſigned with the Sign of the Croſs, in token that thou ſhouldeſt not be aſham'd to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, but manfully fight under his Banner againſt Sin, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; and continue Chriſt's faithful Souldier and Servant unto thy life's end. Conſider, that being come to Underſtanding, thou art brought to take thy Baptiſmal Vow upon thy<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98258:155"/>ſelf in Confirmation, whereby the Soul is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to fight the inward Battles of this Life, and to bear the Croſs. Conſider, that at the receiving the Sacrament, if thou doſt it worthily, thou reneweſt the ſame Vow, and that the Benefits of Chriſt's Death cannot be convey'd to thee therein, but by believing, and working according to thy belief. What is all this, but to teach us, that our Faith ought to be lively, and that believing and doing muſt go together in a Chriſtian? For if thou wanteſt a hand to work, thou wilt alſo want a hand to lay hold of Chriſt's Merits, and to apply them to thy Soul. Beg therefore of God, that he would give thee a true, a vital, and an active Faith, for by that means thou mayeſt have a ſure, and a certain Hope, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Charity; ſince they that believe well, hope well; and they that hope well, love well.</p>
                  <p>He that works as he believes, and believes as Chriſt commands him, hopes in the ſame proportion that he believes. If thou hopeſt as thou believeſt, and believeſt as thou oughteſt, and loveſt in the ſame manner as thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, Heaven and Glory are ſurely thine, thou haſt already conquer'd Hell: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils flie already from thee; The Angels are already with thee; The Saints already bear thee Company; Thou art already under the Protection of thy Bleſſed Saviour, and art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſealed by him for an Heir predeſtinated to his Glory. Pray therefore earneſtly to God
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98258:156"/>for a lively Faith, and then thou ſhalt have certain Hope, and fervent Charity. The Root of that moſt beautiful Tree, is Faith; the green Leaves and fair Flowers of it are Hope; and the ſweet ſavoury Fruit is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This Tree of true Wiſdom is the Tree of Eternal Life, which cures the Wounds of the Tree of Death and of Knowledge. Pant and gaſp after the Fruit of this Spiritual Tree, which is Divine Charity. If thou feeleſt that, if thou poſſeſſeſt that, thou art already grown up, and haſt profited conſiderably in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life. If thou feeleſt the love of God in thee, and that thy heart be warmed with one ſpark thereof, rejoyce and be of good courage, for thou art already near the top of
<hi>Calvary,</hi> which is the Mount of Chriſtian Perfection. The day that God gives a Soul the feeling of his Love, and an eager hearty deſire to ſerve and to pleaſe him, he draws it near to him, and unites it to himſelf; nay, he already gives it a Pledge, that living always ſo, he may ſafely hope never to be parted from him. Haſt thou Divine Charity, and doſt thou feel the love of God within thee? Thou wilt caſt away Humane Paſſions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; and having baniſhed that which is imperfect, that which is perfect will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and increaſe in thee. Haſt thou Divine Charity, and doſt thou feel the love of God? Darkneſs will ſpeedily flie away, and an holy perfect Light will enlighten thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:98258:156"/>O Divine Charity! how great is thy Power! how great is thy Worth! What is it that thou canſt not do? Thou art more Omnipotent in a manner, than Omnipotency itſelf. Thou madeſt the Son of God to leave the Boſom of his Omnipotent Father, to ſeek a Mother, to become Man, and to die on the Croſs for Man; In the doing all which acts of exceſſive Kindneſs, Omnipotency was as it were the Servant of Divine Charity; ſince thoſe things could not have been done, if Omnipotency had not obey'd the infinite Love of God, in performing what his Charity ordained.</p>
                  <p>If thou loveſt God then, I reckon thee ſafe on ſhore. Perſevere, go on with joy and chearfulneſs, and all will be eaſie, ſweet, and pleaſant to thee. The Love of God facilitates the Exerciſes of a Spiritual Life, and makes them ſweet, though in themſelves they be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Love of God chears the Soul, and reſiſts great Storms of Temptations, Afflictions, and Tribulations, and keeps a Conſcience pure, holy, prompt, and lively. The Love of God gives more pleaſure in Suffering, than Pleaſure itſelf does in the enjoying. The Love of God gives Light, and drives away Darkneſs from the heart; and as Night and Day cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together, ſo neither can Divine Charity and Sin. The Love of God gives Strength and Perſeverance in what is good, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conſtancy to oppoſe what is evil. The Love of God roots out Paſſions, Hatred, and Revenge from the heart, and introduces<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98258:157"/>Pity, Goodneſs, and Mercy, with the other excellent Vertues. Finally, the Love of God quickens, defends, comforts, ſtrengthens, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens, and perfects the Heart and Soul; and ſo long as thou keepeſt it there, it brings all under Subjection and Obedience to Reaſon. It is ſtrong, ſweet, and powerful; loving, conſtant, couragious, and chearful; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all that is good, and caſts out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is evil.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe thy ſelf then in Love, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt the Lord ſhould Crown thee. If thou haſt a mind to profit, employ thy heart in loving Day and Night. Love the Lord, who in his Eternal purpoſe loved thee, before there was Day or Night. Let every return of thy breath breathe out the Love of this Lord, ſo that thy reſpiration and thy love to him may he equally conſtant in thee.</p>

All thy Converſation ſhould be with God, of God, and for God. Enter thy ſelf into his Service by Faith, adore him with Reverence, and love all that appertains to him. There is no need for thee to go up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſeek this Lord; ſince for that purpoſe even Earth is Heaven, and all Heaven is to be found in this narrow place of our Baniſhment. Thou oughteſt alſo to bear great Reverence to the Houſes of God, and to Sacred Perſons; for theſe are the Miniſters of God, and do repreſent God; and thoſe are Holy places, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and appointed for his outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

                     <p>'Tis Religion that ſanctifies and gives worth to the four Cardinal, and to the Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; for without it they are only Natural; though they have an outward Beauty, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they are empty of Grace and Value. The Gentiles, Barbarians, Idolaters, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks alſo have Vertues; but they are only Natural ones, they want that Soul, that Spirit, and that Efficacy, which they get by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and intention of ſerving God by them. Without Religion and love to God, thou ſhalt<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98258:158"/>find no Vertue in thy heart, that can deſerve to be ſo called, but the worth of it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, by how much the more it is performed with Purity, Fervour, Attention, and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Endeavour to keep thy Conſcience clean, and to do all things through God, and for God; for that is all thy Vertue, all thy Remedy, and the value of all thy Actions. The ſame pains taken, only by changing the Intention, may either prove an Advantage, or a Ruin to thy Soul. O how good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might the Vicious Man be, if he would but ſuffer ſo much for God in Vertue, as he does to ſatisfie his Luſts in Vice! The Covetous man plows up the Seas, and runs up and down through ſeveral Countries, to get Wealth; but think what Treaſures, what Crowns he might acquire, if he would undergo the ſame hazards, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Holy Apoſtles did, for Zeal of propagating the Faith! See the ardent Paſſion, wherewith the Senſual Man ruſhes upon an Object full of Miſery and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which, though to him a ſeeming Good, is indeed but Loathſomneſs and Folly! If thou gaveſt thy heart and ſoul with as much eagerneſs to God, that true, firſt, and chiefeſt Good, to whom it is due; O how happy mighteſt thou be! Only by changing thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for another Object, they would become holy, which elſe are perverſe and imperfect. Only by changing the Intent and the Action; nay, ſometimes by only changing the Intent, and not the Action, the Heart is made clean<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98258:159"/>and pure, which would elſe be ſinful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. Only by giving that to the Inviſible, which is given to what is Viſible, Men might with the ſame, nay, with leſs pains, lay up Rewards in this Life, which will be delivered to them again in that to come; whereas by employing Diligence to attain ſinful Pleaſures, they alſo procure Eternal Damnation.</p>
                     <p>O what Labours, what Difficulties, what Misfortunes and Afflictions do Mortals under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go here upon Earth! and at laſt either they periſh in the ſearch, or elſe they obtain but periſhing Advantages, which when they have found, and conquer'd, and poſſeſs'd, are all no better than a little Earth! They ſpend their time, which waſtes and comes to an end, in ſeeking, finding, and acquiring that which they long to enjoy; and they always find the Pains, but ſeldom the Enjoyments. Vain Labours! Unprofitable Travels! Ill-employed Pains! and Unhappy Vexations! To ſpend their Time, their Life, their Honour, and their Eſtate, in ſeeking and acquiring that, which it is not a pin matter whether they get or loſe! That, which I no ſooner have deceived my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the delight of poſſeſſing all my life, but I am undeceived with the ſadneſs of having it taken from me by Death!

But this Sorrow, how great ſoever it be, will not procure him the leaſt degree of Reward. Why? Is he not ſorry, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry for having killed him? Yes; but his grief is not for his ſin, nor for having offended God; but he bewails his own Death, and is afflicted for the loſs of his Life; yet let him <pb n="292" facs="tcp:98258:160"/>change his Intention, and he may ſave his Soul with much leſs ſorrow.</p>

Nay, there are ſome that ſay, there is nothing Indifferent, and that whatſoever is not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to God, is guilty and inordinate; and even to walk and diſcourſe, without applying it to God, is in a degree ſinful, though in itſelf it have no other ill, than the not being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to God. Finally, they ſay, that if what we do be not good, it muſt of neceſſity be bad; if not in a high, yet at leaſt in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>O how hard this Judgment ſeems! yet in my Opinion it diſcovers very excellent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Root of it. For we are in ſuch manner Debtors to God, (all our Senſes, Powers, and Faculties being his) and we are ſo much indebted to him for thoſe Talents, which he gave to our management, to the end we might increaſe them in his Service; that not to do ſo, whether it be in a great matter, or in a<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98258:160"/>ſmall, muſt needs be either a ſmall or a great Offence. Work for me, ſays God to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Traffique till I come, ſince to that end it was I gave thee all thou haſt. All that thou doſt not reſtore unto me, thou takeſt away from me. Conſider that thou robbeſt me of all that which thou doſt deny me. To work for any other, or for thy ſelf, as thy ultimate end, is to work againſt me. If thou placeſt thy End in the Creature, thou takeſt it away from the Creator. If thou doſt not place it in me, but either in thy ſelf, or others, thou giveſt that to the Creatures, which thou oweſt to me.
<hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me, and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi> If thou doſt not work for me, becauſe thou wilt not, thou denieſt me thy Will; and if it be, becauſe thou doſt not remember it, thou denieſt me the Memory, which thou oweſt me. He cannot be freed from the blame of Ingratitude to his Benefactor, that forgets the Benefit; but the greater Forgetfulneſs ſeems the greater Ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>Upon this it is they ground themſelves, who ſay, that every indifferent Action, which is not applyed to God, is evil and imperfect; that there is nothing indifferent; that in the ſight of God's Juſtice, whatſoever is not good, is bad; that every action of Man muſt be in the Service either of God, or of <hi>Belial;</hi> and that there are no more than two hands, the Right and the Left, whether the ſin be great or ſmall.</p>

                     <p>PRudence is that Verture, which directs the manner of Humane Society; if it be through God, and for God, it is truly Prudence, for by him it finds fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Means, and holily Guides by a good Way, unto a good End.</p>
                     <p>The Prudence that is of God, and through God, is Divine Prudence, which deſigns all for God, and never fails of its aim, becauſe it is guided by the Rules and Directions of God. This holy Prudence leads the Intention and the Heart, and adorns every Action with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Circumſtances. Avoid and caſt off from thee the falſe and crafty Prudence of the World, which is full of its deceits and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties. Baniſh from thy ſincere Heart, that falſly-call'd Prudence, made up of Lyes and Jugglings, which gounding its deſigns upon falſhood, moſt commonly periſhes, when it<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98258:162"/>comes to conteſt with that, which is true and certain. I have always found, that Truth gets Victory over Lies. I have always ſeen Sincerity fool the Tricks and Cheats of Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs. I have always ſeen the Prudence of God, triumph over that of the World, and if it happen otherwiſe ſometimes, that laſts but for a while, for in the end Truth and Honeſty are Victorious.</p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou be prudent? Work ſincerely, ſpeak always the Truth, take care in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou doeſt for God, not to offend his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Laws, keep the Rules, to which thy State and Profeſſion oblige thee. Let thy Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be ſingle, and thy Actions ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Reaſon; and believe me, thou ſhalt be God's prudent Man, without ſo many tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and windings, as ill Men entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in; without ſo much Pains and Anxiety as it coſteth them, and without ſo many Tricks, Diſſimulations, Plots, and Policies, as the Imprudent prudent Men of this World beat their Brains in contriving.</p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou be Wiſe and Prudent, ſo that no body may deceive thee; but that rather, if they attempt it, they ſhall be deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ruined thee without thy Fault? Then be careful to keep Gods Commandments, live with an holy Plainneſs and Sincerity, and ever ſpeak the Truth. Art thou a Chriſtian? Obey the Laws of Chriſt. Art thou a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man? Keep the Canonical Rules. Art thou a Biſhop? Be careful of thy Dioceſs.<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98258:162"/>Art thou a Lay-man?

Put the Laws in Execution; for who does thus, is Prudent, Wiſe, and Diſcreet, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be deceived, nor deceive others.</p>
                     <p>Deceit laſts not long; Truth and Sincerity defend themſelves, but Doubleneſs and Faſhood have need of Friends to defend them. A right Intention makes an Action to be Right and Prudent. And if at any time it be requiſite for the good Prudence, to diſſemble and be ſilent, it knows how to diſſemble and be ſilent, yet without feigning, lying, or deceiving. The good Prudence has ſo heedful a Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Actions, that what the falſe one does with great Labour, it performs with Facility. It examines and diſpoſes the means ſweetly and orderly unto their End, and having choſen an holy End, makes uſe of good and diſcreet means for the attaining of it. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as the Ends of the World's Wiſe Men are foul, ſo likewiſe their means are foul and vain. The Prudent Men of the World uſe to be more ſubtle in their ways (ſays our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) but not more conſtant, nor more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.

Conſider the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances that ariſe from the ill management of Laws, and of Publick Reſolutions. All this<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98258:163"/>diſorder, all this exceſs or defect, omiſſion and commiſſion, and all this perverting of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from our ſwerving from that Eternal Rule of Internal and Superiour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which God imprinted in Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and which his Grace afterwards did more illuſtrate by his Holy Laws, Counſels, and Directions.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, what Juſtice there can be in the heart of him who is unjuſt in himſelf, and who is poſſeſſed with filthy Appetites, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Paſſions? That Juſtice which begins with ſo terrible an Injuſtice; as to throw God out of the Poſſeſſion of his heart, how can it deſerve the name of Juſtice? Or how can that be ſo called, which does not oblige a Man to do within himſelf, as he deſires that others ſhould do without himſelf? The firſt thing, that a wicked and partial Judge does, is to rob God, by taking away his own Heart, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and Diſcourſe from him, and giving it to the common Enemy. Now where is this Judge like to end, that begins thus with playing the Thief? He that robs God of that which is his, what Robberies will he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit upon Man? 'Tis manifeſt, that his Juſtice will be but a tolerated and applauded Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; ſince he is to Judge and paſs Sentence openly, who is himſelf already Judged and Condemned ſecretly. Partiality and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarineſs will ſway his Sentence, to free a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, if he be his Friend, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn an Innocent, if his Enemy. He will<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98258:164"/>prefer one that bribes and flatters him, and reject another, that neither preſents nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him. He will prefer his own Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Pleaſure, Profit, or Will, before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, Quiet, and Security. In all his Actions he will meaſure the Publick Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency with his own, and leave his neglect and careleſneſs to the Publick. All his Diligence and Watchfulneſs ſhall be for himſelf, but not the leaſt part of either for God, or the due performance of his Publick Employment.</p>
                     <p>Now wouldſt thou do Juſtice, and be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in that Vertue? Then firſt be juſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy ſelf, and then thou wilt not fail of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice to others. Settle and govern thy inward Common-wealth with Holineſs. Let God and Reaſon, and the Rules thereof, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that little World which thou haſt within thee, and then thou mayeſt come forth holy and juſt to govern the World without thee. Is it not certain, that if thy little World be diſturbed, confuſed, and in diſorder, the great World will be ſo likewiſe, as far as thou haſt the Government of it? If the Governour himſelf be naught, how ſhall it go with the thing governed? If a furious Storm have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and carried away the Rudder, what ſhall become of the poor Ship? If thou and I, when we are Superiours, be the Rudder and Government of the People; and if we will be ungoverned and deſtroyed by Vice, how ſhall they be governed and preſerved in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Let us govern our ſelves firſt, and then<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98258:164"/>we may be fit to govern others. Let us do Juſtice in our own Houſes, and then having given credit to it by that means, it will enter powerfully and effectually into the Houſes of others.</p>
                     <p>With what colour of Modeſty can the Judge, that is inwardly unjuſt, act outwardly againſt a Criminal, or a guilty Perſon, finding himſelf more guilty than that Criminal? Will not his Heart and his Conſcience in every Action be condemning and laſhing him for his own Injuſtice? Will it not call out unto him with clear and loud cries, and ſpeak truth to his Soul in the midſt of his falſhood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit? Saying, Why doſt thou condemn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O thou wicked Judge, being thy ſelf the moſt worthy of Condemnation? Thou Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, thou ſeeſt the ſmalleſt Mote in the Eye of another, and doſt thou not ſee the Beam in thine own? Wilt thou guide, and reſtrain, and govern others, being blind, and looſe, and diſorderly thy ſelf? Take away thine own Beam, and then thou mayeſt ſee to take away the other's Mote. Govern thy ſelf, and then thou mayeſt govern the People. Amend thy ſelf, and then thou mayeſt amend them; Corect thy ſelf, and then correct them. Firſt do Juſtice within thy ſelf, and then thou wilt likewiſe do it abroad. Wouldſt thou be juſt towards others? Then rectifie thy ſelf. Cleanſe the Affections of thy Soul, and thou ſhalt ſee clearly. Paſſions are as the Eye-lids of the Soul, they cloſe themſelves upon it,<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98258:165"/>and take away all its light. Lift up thoſe Lids, ſet aſide thoſe Paſſions, and look up to God, and thou ſhalt ſee, and ſhine, and burn, and give light to others.</p>

                     <head>Of Fortitude</head>
                     <p>The ſame thing thou findeſt concerning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, thou wilt alſo find concerning Fortitude, whoſe exterior practiſe depends totally upon the interiour. This excellent Vertue is the Crown of the reſt; ſince it conſerves, ſtrengthens, and defends them all. Fortitude in its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, is Valour; in its Behaviour, is Prudence; in its Cauſe, is Juſtice; and in its Execution, Temperance. Since then that Fortitude is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Prudence, Juſtice, Temperance, nay, and Perſeverance too, how can it conſiſt with the Vice, Weakneſs, and Inconſtancy of a Man, that governs not himſelf by Reaſon, but is ſubjected and enſlav'd by Paſſion? He that is not ſtrong in himſelf, muſt needs be weak againſt others; for he is wholly governed by his inordinate Paſſion, which in itſelf is meer weakneſs and debility.</p>
                     <p>What doſt thou think that Fortitude is? Doſt thou believe it is to conquer Provinces, and to trample under foot Kingdoms, and to tyrannize over the World? This rather is a crowned Weakneſs, a reſpected Violence, and a publick Peſt. What matter is it for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Tyrant to preſent his Face to the Enemy, if at the ſame time he turn his back to Vertue?<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98258:165"/>What matter is it though he defeat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Army he fights againſt, if at the ſame time he be conquer'd and dragg'd in Triumph by his Paſſions? That cannot be Vertue, which is the cauſe of innumerable Crimes, and is a Crime itſelf in its very root.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great ſubdued all the World, but was the great and publick Thief of the World. His Commanders puniſh one that ſteals a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats, whilſt he in one Year Robs and Uſurps Thirty Kingdoms, and that was a Crowned, a Reverenced, and an Adored Crime. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who, if he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd himſelf of his Neighbour's Inheritance, would have been baniſh'd from <hi>Rome,</hi> Uſurps and takes Poſſeſſion of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, deſtroying and cutting the Throats of innumerable Neighbours and Citizens; and is ador'd by
<hi>Rome,</hi> and by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Shall we aſcribe the Vertue of Fortitude to thoſe Royal and Imperial Crowned Serpents of the Earth, who laid waſte, and diſpeopled the Earth? Shall we allow that <hi>Atila,</hi> or <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila,</hi> with ſuch like Monſters of Cruelty were endowed with the Vertue of Fortitude? Theſe and their Fellows, who by their weak and powerleſs Ambition over-turn'd the World, deſtroyed, pillaged, burned, and razed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Cities, Kingdoms, Nations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, at the ſame time while they were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the World, were themſelves captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:98258:166"/>No, theſe were not truly ſtrong and valiant, but Men powerfully weak, who turned the World upſide down. They had been valiant, if their Valour had overcome their Paſſion, and if they had known how to confine their hearts within the limits of Reaſon. <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had been truly Valiant, if he had defended his Country, and Citizens, and had been able to defend himſelf from himſelf, without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Name of Citizen to that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. We might have aſcrib'd Fortitude to <hi>Alexander,</hi> if he had governed his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Peace, defending his Crown in juſt War, within the Bounds of
<hi>Macedonia;</hi> but to make an Inundation upon <hi>Aſia,</hi> to take away ſo many Crowns, and make them the Trophies of his Ambition, was a powerful Weakneſs, but neither Valour nor Fortitude. The Vertue of Fortitude preſerves the Mind in that which is right, juſt, and holy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſenting to let Paſſion enter to diſorder and triumph over Reaſon. He that is firſt conquer'd by the Vertue of Fortitude, will have force to conquer himſelf, ſubduing his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, making it yield to Reaſon, and ſetting that up to Reign and Govern in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Shall he that diſquiets a City, and makes hurly-burlies in it, becoming the ſcandal of the People, be ſaid to have the Vertue of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, though he kill, and burn, and make himſelf the Terror of a Country? He has only a ſtrong Frailty, ſo mad and frantick, that he can neither order nor contain himſelf<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98258:166"/>within thoſe Honeſt and Lawful terms, which are allowed in our Commerce with others. He lives and acts, as being dragg'd and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on by his Fancy and Humour, and would he then have us think him to be truly Valiant? The Powerful Prince, the King that defends his Crown juſtly and orderly; the General that Governs his Army rightly, keeping Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline; the Judge, who conſtantly repelling Paſſions and Partialities, gives to every one that which is his own, working in ſubjection to the Laws of God, and thoſe of his Country; the Honeſt Man, that walks fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes only upon God and Reaſon; the Modeſt Woman, that firmly and conſtantly defends her Chaſtity; theſe may indeed be ſaid to have the Vertue of Fortitude. The good Prelate, that with juſt Diſcipline governs the Souls under his Charge; the Glorious Martyr, who in the midſt of Perſecution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed, or rather crowned with Torments and Tyrants, yet breaths Valour, Conſtancy, and Perſeverance. Finally, all thoſe who give their Body, their Fame, their Fortune, or their Life for the ſaving of their Soul, and keep that ſtrong, conſtant, and perſevering in goodneſs, only for God's ſake, whether they ſuffer, or ſuffer not; whether they are eſteemed or deſpiſed in the World; Theſe are they that are truly Valiant, and are eminently poſſeſs'd of that honourable, glorious, and couragious Vertue of Holy Fortitude.</p>

                     <p>TEmperance, which moderates our Paſſions, and governs our Souls with rectitude, hath its Root alſo in Religion, and muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect itſelf to God, if it will be a perfect Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Its Duty is to reduce the Appetite, both iraſcible and concupiſcible, to moderate bounds, in order to God and his Holy Laws. Anger is the Sword of Reaſon, which ſometimes ſhe is neceſſitated to draw, to defend her ſelf, but yet acts in ſuch a manner, that by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance ſhe cuts out only what is ſufficient, without paſſing on to what is ſuperfluous. There have been Natural Philoſophers that condemn'd Anger, and would have Reaſon to be ſufficient of itſelf; they thought to deveſt Humane Nature of Paſſions, was enough to make it to act prudently, without any other means, pretending to bring mens minds to an inſenſibility, and to baniſh from them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Natural Affections; but they deceived themſelves, for it is neither poſſible nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that Reaſon ſhould quite lay aſide the uſe of Paſſions and Affections, becauſe they<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98258:167"/>move our hearts to act. That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and poſſible, is by the help of Grace to govern our Affections well, and to regulate our Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Let the Prince be angry, as much as Juſtice and Occaſion requires, and let him moderate his Anger by the right Rule of Reaſon. A General, that ſees an unjuſt and cruel Enemy coming to deſtroy his Army, may and ought to defend himſelf with Anger, and ſtir up his Fury to obtain the Victory. Let the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour uſe his Anger to chaſtiſe the wicked, and yet at the ſame time have compaſſion upon the wicked. Let Reaſon Command, let An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Serve and Obey; and let them joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to go as far as is convenient. <hi>Be angry</hi> (ſays the Lord) <hi>but ſin not;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Let Reaſon temper Anger, and let Anger be ſubſervient to Reaſon. The Zeal of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was angry, flew thoſe that rebelled againſt the Law; that of <hi>Elias</hi> brought Fire from Heaven upon the Souldiers of <hi>Ahab.</hi> Heaven did adminiſter Fire to his Zeal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Zeal was moved with a juſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Anger. Our Saviour alſo ſanctified An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when ſeeing the Temple of his Eternal Father profaned by the <hi>Jews,</hi> he twice took up the Whip to drive out the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and when he threw down the Tables of the Money-Changers. Thou muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think that an eaſie clemency and ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſuffers the bad to run to ruin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of Temperance; for to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98258:168"/>the bad, and leave the good undefended, is not Temperance, but a baſe Remiſneſs, and deteſtable Negligence. For Superiours to be ſluggiſh, whilſt Subjects are inſolent, is ſo far from Temperance, that it is an egregious Intemperance.</p>
                     <p>Temperance is that, which neither comes ſhort in what is right, nor goes ſo far as what is prohibited. Temperance is that which does not puniſh, when it is urged by Grief or Importunity; but when Reaſon appoints, and the Nature of the thing requires. Temperance is that, which does what God commands, and neither ſwerves from it by exceſs, in going too far; nor by defect, in doing too little. It is not Temperance for a Man utterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear eating, but to eat temperately. It does not forbid a Man to ſuſtain his Body, but to give it as much as the inordinate Appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. It gives that which is ſufficient, but allows not that which is exceſſive. When the Appetite asks what is neceſſary, it grants it; but if it demand what is hurtful, it denies it. Thus Temperance is the Bridle of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, whether it be concupiſcible, or iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>Temperance has two Reins in her hand, ſometimes ſhe ſtops, ſometimes ſhe puts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; now ſhe turns on the one hand, now on the other. Whitherſoever the Law, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Divine Will directs, thither ſhe guides. How ſhould all be governed without Error, if the Mind be not moderated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98258:168"/>with Reaſon, and ſubdued with Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification? How is it poſſible, that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without God ſhould be able to contain and moderate man's unbridled Appetite, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iraſcible or concupiſcible? Or how can it without the power of Grace, ſubdue our corrupt, rebellious, and unruly Nature? How can this outward part be governed, unleſs God illuminate and guide it from within? And what can ſhew us the way of Vertue here below, but the light that comes in to us from above?</p>
                     <p>The Gentiles did practiſe ſome Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with Temperance, yet even in them, and in others, they themſelves acted with Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. <hi>Diogenes</hi> an humorous, overwean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wilfully-poor Philoſopher, tramples with his bare Feet all dirty upon the ſtately Train of <hi>Plato,</hi> a wealthy Philoſopher richly apparell'd: <hi>Plato</hi> asked <hi>Diogenes,</hi> What doſt thou? He anſwers, I trample upon
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Pride. Yes, reply'd <hi>Plato,</hi> but with a greater Pride. Here the very Light of Nature judg'd among the Gentiles, and enlighten'd them to ſee their Errors; and one Pride reformed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for there was Pride in both. <hi>Plato</hi> will be an Heavenly Man, full of Vanity and Pride, and faſt giued to the Commodities of Life, playing the Philoſopher about Eternity only in Speculation, but giving up his Will and Paſſion wholly to Temporal things. <hi>Diogenes</hi> on the contrary deſpiſing outward things, was neither contented in himſelf, nor could live<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98258:169"/>quiet among others, being full of an inward Pride, that contemned, abuſed, and offended all. Both of them were acted by Intemperance, and were Philoſophers of this World and of Nature, but not true Philoſophers of God, nor of the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                     <p>If one of the Saints, or ancient Fathers of the Church, had come into the richly-furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Room of <hi>Plato,</hi> he would have deſpis'd, but not trampled upon his coſtly Furniture. He would have deſpis'd his Riches with the ſame holy Humility, wherewith he deſpiſed himſelf. He would have deſpis'd the brave Hangings and Carpets of
<hi>Plato,</hi> but not the Perſon of <hi>Plato.</hi> O the Celeſtial Knowledge of God, and of his holy Law! O incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Wiſdom! How pure and clear, how bright thou ſhineſt in the heart of a Chriſtian, who ſuffers himſelf to be govern'd by thy Light, and directed by thy Means! It is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing to think there is any perfect Vertue without God; neither Prudence, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Fortitude, nor Temperance can be ſo without him: for without God Prudence is Imprudence, Juſtice is Injuſtice; Fortitude is Weakneſs, and Temperance Intemperance. If God does not govern, order, temper, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten it; if he does not guide and direct it, natural Vertue will be ſo weak, and full of imperfections, that it will ſtumble at every ſtep: If it go right now, it goes wrong with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moment, and if here it puniſhes the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there it condemns the Innocent: But the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98258:169"/>Government of God, and that Soveraign Light which enlightens a Righteous Man, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Grace which aſſiſts and counſels him, that is it which thou art to pray for, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obtain; that is it that muſt temper thee, if thou wouldſt attain to the true pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Moral Vertues.</p>

                     <p>It is therefore very uſeful and convenient in the Spiritual Life to walk in the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with the light of Prayer in our hands, to the end, that by the brightneſs thereof, we may with God's Grace and Spirit chooſe the fitteſt means for ſo high an end, deſpiſing vain and worldly Wiſdom, and making uſe of one, that is Divine, Spiritual, and Celeſtial. O let thy Prudence and Diſcretion conſiſt in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ways of thy Salvation! All the means thou employeſt to this end, are Chriſtian, good, holy, juſt, powerful, and prudent. And all thoſe Motives, which would put thee out of thoſe ways, though they ſeem to come ſhining with Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude and Temperance, are really unjuſt, weak, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and very imprudent.</p>
                     <p>The end of any thing ought to govern the means. Thy end ought to be to ſave thy Soul, to ſerve, pleaſe, and not to offend God; to live an internal and ſpiritual life, to make thy life a preparation for death; to fit thy ſelf by death for Judgment, by Judgment for thy Account, and by thy Account for that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which may deliver thee from Eternal Condemnation, and give thee the Crown of Glory in Life Eternal. Oh! What an heavenly Prudence is this. Oh what Juſtice! What Fortitude! What Temperance! How well<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98258:171"/>are they all temper'd with one another! and and how imprudent, and unjuſt, how fooliſh, how mad, how diſtemper'd, and how ruinous is the contrary!</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe four, which were wont to be Natural, Politick, and Heathen Vertues, thou mayeſt by a right intention and direction, transform into Chriſtian and Spiritual ones; taking from Prudence not what the Fleſh, but what the Spirit requires; from Juſtice, not what the Inferiour but the Superiour directs; from Fortitude, not what Paſſion, but what Reaſon commands; and from Temperance, what is allowed by God, not by the World and the Devil.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of Humility, and its contrary Pride.</head>
                  <p>WIth theſe Rules (which are not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and natural, but holy and ſpiritual) concerning the four Cardinal Vertues, the firſt thing that thou art to practiſe continually in the life of the Soul, is Humility. This is an unſpeakable Vertue indeed, and the Mother of all the reſt; for they are all bred and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in her Bowels. Humility is that which the Eternal Word choſe among all the reſt,<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98258:172"/>when being God he became Fleſh, to dwell amongſt us clothed in our Humane Nature; for the Immenſe and Omnipotent Lord of Heaven ſhew'd himſelf in this World ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo poor, as to be born in a Stable; ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſo limited, as to be contained in a Manger: He conſecrated Humility, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelf to it, through the whole Courſe of his moſt holy Life, from the Virginal inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Mother's Womb, and taught it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs by his moſt holy Death. This is that which he has left for an Inheritance to his faithful Followers, when he ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, for</hi> I <hi>am meek and lowly in heart;</hi> and when afterwards having humbled himſelf at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet, he bad them do as he had done.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen already how great a number of Vertues, our bleſſed Saviour, the Example of Chriſtian Perfection, did practiſe, whilſt he liv'd in this World, leaving us to imitate that Divine Original; and yet for all that he calls upon us, ſollicits, and perſwades us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to Copy none, but his Humility. Why did he not call upon us to practiſe his Patience? Why did he not bid us learn his Charity? Why not his Zeal and Diligence? Why not his Fortitude, Juſtice, and Temperance, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Humility? By reaſon that the greateſt fall and wound of both the Natures, Angelical and Humane, was Pride; and ſo that Nature of the two, that remains in a poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cured, which is the Humane, and which our Lord came to remedy, finds<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98258:172"/>its principal Medicine in Humility.</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou ſee how contrary Pride is to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that thou mayeſt the better know, how contrary Humility is to Pride? Why, Pride is the Natural Mother of all the Devils? ſhe engendred them in her Bowels, and an Infernal Pride made them Devils of ſo many Angels; they would needs be like God, and equal themſelves to him in Power; and that Pride threw them in an inſtant from Heaven into the bottomleſs Pit.</p>
                  <p>Would'ſt thou now ſee what Humility is? It is that which made Angels to be more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels than they were before; for when taking warning by the Fall of their Companions, they humbled themſelves before God, he confirmed them in his Grace, and fixed them for Angels eternally in his Glory, above the danger of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becoming Devils.</p>
                  <p>And would'ſt thou ſee what Pride is? Look upon our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their higheſt Felicity of
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee, that becauſe they would be as Gods, and paſs from Humane Limits to Divine; they were inſtantly caſt out, baniſh'd, naked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, ſowing Tribulations and Sorrows, and reaping Thorns, Afflictions, and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>Would'ſt thou ſee what is Humility? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thoſe ſame firſt Parents weeping, grieving, and bewailing their Fault with an humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, and thou wilt alſo behold them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Divine Goodneſs, and both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98258:173"/>and their Poſterity reſtored to Grace and Glory, with a remedy more noble, and much ſuperiour to the Felicity they had loſt.</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou ſee what Pride is? Look upon <hi>Cain,</hi> who deſpiſes God by denying the beſt of his Fruits, which were due to him, as the Author and Lord of the Inheritance; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proud and covetous forgets the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Example, and the Tears of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and would exempt himſelf from that juſt and holy Tribute. This Sin carries him to another, which is worſe, I mean that of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; and Envy thruſts him on to a higher, that of Murder, even the murder of a Brother; and this drives him to the greateſt of all, which is final Obſtinacy and Impenitence. He lives in Deſpair, flying from himſelf, and dying wounded with a deadly Arrow, becomes the Head of the Reprobates, and the Damned.</p>
                  <p>And wilt thou ſee on the other ſide, what Humility is? Look upon holy and bleſſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> who humbly acknowledges his Eternal Creator, by offering him his Fruits. He gives him the beſt of them, and the beſt of his Soul, which is Humility; whereupon God bleſſes, favours, and crowns him, as being the firſt Martyr of Heaven, and the Firſt-fruits of thoſe that were called, appointed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated by the Will of Chriſt to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Glory. Finally, theſe firſt ſucceſſes and contrary effects of theſe two Contraries, have been followed by innumerable others, and there<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98258:173"/>is nothing ſeen, nor has been ſeen, nor ever ſhall be ſeen, but the ruins of Pride, and the triumphs of Humility.</p>
                  <p>Therefore of all thoſe Vertues thou oughteſt to follow and exerciſe in this Spiritual Life, there is none thou ſhouldeſt ſo deeply medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon, nor ſo earneſtly beg that God would give thee, as that of holy Humility. Though Humility be a Vertue, as it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, yet it is a Gift as it is beſtow'd; and therefore it is needful to beg it of God, with earneſtneſs, conſtancy, and humbleneſs. So great is our Pride, and ſo great is our Vanity, that without a particular ſuccour and favour of our good Maſter Jeſus, we are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true, holy, and perfect Humility. Pride is ſo natural to us, and ſo rooted in us, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when we exerciſe our ſelves in Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Humility, we are wont (unleſs God by Grace prevent it) to make them the matter of our Vanity: How miſchievous muſt that needs be, which turns our Remedy into a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? How great is my Pride, if when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſelf meekly and humbly, I often riſe up again proud, inſolent, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</p>
                  <p>Even in the midſt of Humility, there may ſpring up a Vanity of being Humble, and an inward Pride may grow out of a Conceit of my Humility, which is worſe than an outward Pride, cloath'd with Vanity, for that, when it hurts, does undeceive; but this both hurts and deceives together. O Lord of Mercy and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98258:174"/>that my Vanity ſhould be ſo exceſſive, as to make me (unleſs thou prevent it) grow vain and proud in the very Temple of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! That I ſhould profane thoſe holy Walls, and upon the Altar of the Lord, ſet up the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and that I ſhould adore my ſelf in that place, where I ought to adore none, but God alone!</p>
                  <p>Therefore beg Humility of God without ceaſing, and whatſoever thou ſhalt do, that is orderly, right, honeſt, good, holy, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſtill beg of God Humility. If thou wert able to give ſight to the Blind, ſtrength to the Lame, Ears to the Deaf, nay even to raiſe the Dead, yet tremble, and pray to God for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. If thou could'ſt ſpeak as an Angel, and do Works that might become a Seraphim; If thou draweſt all the World after thee, and that for God; if thou converteſt Souls; if thou art a Maſter in Spirit and Perfection, and that all thou goeſt about ſucceeds to thy deſires; yet tremble, and pray to God for Humility. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, between Hell and thoſe Succeſſes, Miracles, and Perfections, there is not the breadth of a finger; I ſay, not ſo much; ſince all the diſtance between them is but thine own Will, which is weaker and of leſs power than thy finger.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou work Miracles? Why ſo did <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> Doſt thou know much? <hi>Lucifer</hi> knew more. Art thou good? <hi>Adam</hi> was much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Are thy Writings heavenly? Thoſe of <hi>David</hi> were much more ſo. Haſt thou Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98258:174"/>Revelations? So had
<hi>Solomon.</hi> Yet ſome of theſe fell, and others of them were loſt for ever. Humility! I ſay Humility! Stick cloſe to that, for thereby all things ſhall redound to thy profit, and without it any thing may be thy ruine and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Go with humble confidence into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord; with humbleneſs, becauſe thou art wicked; and with confidence, becauſe he is infinitely good. Go with contrition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees thy wickedneſs; and go with cheerfulneſs, becauſe thou fixeſt thy eyes upon his goodneſs. Never place the end of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in thy ſelf, nor believe in thy Works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that thou ſhalt go to Heaven for them, or that thine own hands and feet ſhall carry thee thither. Thou ſhalt not enter there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, but neither ſhalt thou enter for them. It is God that carries us to Heaven, and his Grace, his Goodneſs, his Pity, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, his Death, Paſſion, and Mercy; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, let us do what we can, and take ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much pains, we ſhall never be able to get thither. It is a better Phraſe to ſay, God has taken him up to Heaven, than to ſay, He is gone to Heaven. God carries us, guides us, helps us. God calls, pardons, and crowns us, and all this becauſe he loves us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that holy Beggar, was carried by Angels to
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom; but the rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton went to Hell of himſelf. God carries us to Heaven, if we be ſav'd, and we condemn our ſelves, if we be damned. Doſt thou look<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98258:175"/>upon thy good works? Thou oweſt them all to God. Doſt thou ſee the Repentance that reformes thee, the Chaſtity that adorns thee, and the Charity that enflames thee? Thou art endebted for them all to God. The Pot dreſs'd up with Flowers is not proud of them, for it is but a little Earth and Dung honour'd by the hand of the Gardiner. What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? And if thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, why doſt thou fooliſhly boaſt, as if thou hadſt not received it? They are the words of the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> He that has wrought beſt in the Spiritual Life; he that has been a Martyr of Perfection; he that has liv'd ſo, as to ſtrike all the World with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit and Fervour; he that has moſt exerciſed himſelf in all Verrtues; the moſt generous Martyr, the glorious Apoſtles, St.
<hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> the moſt holy Virgin, and all the Saints and juſt Perſons at their entring and being crown'd in Glory, do not give thanks to their own Excellencies, nor aſcribe their Salvation to themſelves, but unto God, and to his Mercy, Goodneſs, Blood, and precious Merits, which gave them thoſe Excellencies and Vertues. They liv'd humbly, they entred with humbleneſs into Heaven, and they are crowned for their Humility. Therefore be thou humble, and do not think thy ſelf the Author of thy Fortune, when it is good; but when it is bad acknowledge that thou art ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:98258:175"/>Depend for all thy Fortune upon God. Thoſe hands that made, and faſhioned thee, will preſerve, inform, and reform thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that of thy ſelf, thou art nothing but a ſource of miſery, and that thou haſt no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor any ſtability in thee, but what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee by his Goodneſs, Grace and Mercy. Attribute all that is good and holy in thee to God, to whom it all belongs; but all that is evil, wretched, and imperfect, to thy ſelf, for that only is thine own. Labour, ſweat, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, exerciſe thy ſelf in what is good, and with care and diligence avoid all that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: But in doing all this, rely nothing upon thy ſelf without God, but truſt all to him, who is thy Helper within thee, above thee, and round about thee.</p>
                  <p>Then let the Humility, which thou embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt inwardly, ſhoot forth alſo outwardly in all thy Actions; for it is not eaſie to believe that internal Humility can dwell with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vanity. Let thy words and actions ſuit with an humble heart; for to praiſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud ones ſelf openly, and pretend to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and reſpected, does not make it very probable that Humility is lodged within. The Humility of that Mind comes very ſhort, that cannot reach from the inſide to the outſide, the diſtance being ſo little between one and the other. <hi>The Tree is known by its fruit,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, and the Root is known by the Tree; and for a Man to be proud in his outward behaviour, and to be very humble
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98258:176"/>in his heart, are two things very hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</p>
                  <p>Do not excuſe thy ſelf with thy Office or Dignity, thereby to be diſpens'd from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Humility, and from conforming it to the internal. There is no Dignity ſo high, wherein Humility may not apparently ſhine forth. Our Kings, who in publick repreſent the Majeſty of God, do often exerciſe their Humility in touching the pooreſt Cripples, and ſometimes even in waſhing the feet of their Maundy-men after Chriſt's Example. Why cannot the Biſhop repreſent his Dignity in his Cathedral, and afterwards exerciſe his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Humility with the Poor at home? He is no leſs honourable at their naked feet, waſhing and kiſſing them, than in the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Church, and of his Dignity: If in the one he repreſents Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> in the other he repreſents the Humility our Saviour practiſe at his laſt Supper.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, when the Vertues do not break forth from the internal, and ſhew themſelves in the external, they are much to be ſuſpected; and thoſe Affections are ſeldom powerful, that can be ſtifled, and conceal'd within. Can'ſt thou think that thou art humble, when ſeeing thy ſelf deſpis'd, thou breakeſt out like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in thy Defence? Thou mayeſt be humble in thine own conceit, but art far from being ſo in good earneſt. They that are both outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly humble, do not deſpiſe others, but yet they deſpiſe themſelves, and are ſo far
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98258:176"/>from being ſenſible when they are deſpis'd, that they rejoyce and delight in being deſpiſed, which are the four degrees of perfect Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy ſelf? Seek them not.</hi> Be not eager to get Offices and Places of Honour, but ſet thy ſelf down in the loweſt room, as the Holy Jeſus adviſeth, leſt a more honourable than thou come, and thou be fain with ſhame to leave it, and remove lower. There may be reaſon ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſhew thy reaſon to make thy ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, yet I fear very much, that in thoſe matters they are but thine own reaſonings, and not right reaſon.</p>
                  <p>It has happened heretofore to me poor, weak, vain, and wretched Man, to ſet forth ſuch reaſons my ſelf, and (as one who then had but ſmall light) ſometimes to enforce them alſo, thinking that therein I did very good ſervice; but looking afterwards upon thoſe occaſions in a clearer light, I ſaw that was but deceit, and vanity, and no perfect Humility. True Humility is, when a Man humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Will of God, and ſuffers himſelf to be governed thereby; when he thinks, that there is no Employment ſo mean, as his deſert, and that every Dignity is too high for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs. The reaſons that are contrary to this, are reaſons ſought for, but not found. They are Reaſons of Nature, but ſeldom of the Spirit, or of Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:98258:177"/>This which ſeems to thee to be Humility, is conveniency and ſafety; for the humble Man is quiet in his Humility, whilſt the proud Man labours, and endangers himſelf by his Pride. I have read of an holy Man, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of ſeeing one fall from an high Dignity to a Scaffold, threw himſelf flat on the ground, taking faſt hold of it with his hands, and being asked, why he did ſo? He anſwer'd crying out, <hi>That I may not fall.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in natural reaſon, a Man of an humble heart cannot fall. Whither can he fall, that through Humility lies proſtrate upon the Earth? He may well get up higher, but can go no lower. He may well riſe, and be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but who can humble him that hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortified himſelf? Therefore it is that our Lord hath ſaid, They that exalt themſelves in this Life ſhall be humbled in the other; and in the ſame proportion that a Man humbles himſelf here, he ſhall be exalted hereafter. The Eternal Word abaſed himſelf in coming down to the Earth, and laying himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate upon it; but he quickly after aſcended into Heaven to be crowned there. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, <hi>Lucifer</hi> would needs be crowned in Heaven, but for his puniſhment was thrown down headlong into Hell. Thus thou ſeeſt Humility not only is honour and profit, but alſo (as I told thee before) ſafety, convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, peace, joy, and comfort. How courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the humble Man! What a many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and vexations is he freed from! All ſeek<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98258:177"/>for the humble Perſon to honour him; and he by having Humility, appeaſes, quiets, and pacifies them all. If they deſpiſe me (ſays the true humble Man) it is that I deſire. If they eſteem me, it is a thing I have found, which belongs not to me, and therefore I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up to God, who is the right owner of it; for what am I but Earth, and Dung, Duſt, Aſhes, and Corruption? This is my own, this is what I deſerve; which is to be humbled, perſecuted, and deſpiſed.</p>

                     <p>IF thou be humble, thou wilt be alſo liberal, for the humble Man deſires nothing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Every thing is too much for his Poverty, for true Poverty is true Humility. He that is of an humble heart, flies from his own honour and excellency; but he that is proud loves his riches, and heaps them up, that he may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, reſpected, reverenc'd, and ador'd; for he ſeeks his own excellency, and delights in it. Covetouſneſs is the Daughter of Pride, which is the fruitful Mother of Vices; for ſhe nouriſhes, ſupports, and encreaſes them. There go many Vices to the forming of Covetouſneſs, many to the practiſe, and many to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>The Root of all Evil.</hi> Covetouſneſs made <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt of the Damned; becauſe that he might keep the beſt Fruits for himſelf, he gave the worſt to God. Covetouſneſs put the Whip twice in the hand of Chriſt to drive it out of<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98258:178"/>the Temple, becauſe it made his Father's Houſe a Den of Thieves. Conſider the Saviour of Souls made angry. Conſider that infinite Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gentleneſs made fierce, and thou mayeſt judge how terrible that Vice is, which could bring his infinite Pity to be ſo ſevere. Covetouſneſs, of a Diſciple made <hi>Judas</hi> a Traitor, and wrought upon him to ſell his Maſter, transforming him from a choſen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, into the worſt Man that ever was born.</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, Humility and Liberality, the Enemies of Covetouſneſs, are the Mothers of Poverty of Spirit, of unconcernedneſs for the Goods of this World, and of diſ-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all things created. They love moſt their Creator, who delight moſt to humble, diveſt, and ſet themſelves at liberty in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor would draw after them thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, Snares, and Miſeries of this Life, which they call Riches. The Poor Man, that is not humble, may be as inſolent as the Rich; and many times more than the Rich; but he that is poor and humble too, can neither be Inſolent, nor does pretend, or deſire to be Wealthy.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes to paſs, that the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man is very free and liberal; for he that deſires nothing for himſelf, does eaſily give away all; and he that thinks that all he has is too much for him, does neither covet nor deſire any thing he has not. Thus the humble and meek of heart are not only liberal and<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98258:179"/>forward to give Alms, but prodigal after an holy manner; and when they want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to give, they readily give their very ſelves. <hi>Serapion</hi> the <hi>Sindonite</hi> gave his upper-Coat to a poor Man he met, and paſſing on further, he gave his under one to another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in a manner naked, with only the New Teſtament in his hand, which he alſo gave away to a third; and being ask'd, Who ſtripped him ſo? He anſwered, that Charity had ſtrip'd him of his upper-Coat, the Goſpel of his under one, and of the Book of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, Chriſt himſelf, the Author of the Goſpel. This ſame Man ſold himſelf twice to Slavery, that he might convert his Maſters. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop, after he had given all he had to the poor, hired himſelf out by the Day, that he might have wherewithal to give; therefore fly from Covetouſneſs more than from the Fire. Love Holy Poverty, Charity, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and if thou muſt exceed in any kind, rather err on the right hand of giving, than on the left hand of refuſing.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour (as an Ancient Father of the Church ſays) is always between two Thieves, and this is moſt verified in the Moral Vertues; becauſe the exceſs or defect deſtroys the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; which conſiſts in the middle. He that does not give that which is ſufficient, is covetous. He that gives too much, is prodigal; but he that gives that which is uſeful, fitting, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, is liberal, and ſo with him Jeſus Chriſt is to be found. Therefore when through Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98258:179"/>frailty thou art like to err on the one hand, or the other, and doſt not know how to walk ſtraight in the middle way; keep on the right hand, for the Prodigal Man is the good Thief, and the evil Thief is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and God more eaſily pardons him that gives.</p>
                     <p>I always obſerve in the Holy Goſpel Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Perſons pardoned, and Covetous ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> was tax'd of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, for breaking the Box of precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſerve our Redeemer, which was great waſt according to appearance. O Heavenly Prodigal, all ſeems little to her for the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Lord! She breaks the Box, and with it all her vain deſires; ſhe caſts her ſelf down a prodigal Sinner, and preſently roſe up a pardoned Saint; ſhe was Prodigal in good, and ſo what ſhe did, was to be accounted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love than waſt; but the Prodigal Son was Prodigal in Evil, and ſpent his Portion fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly amongſt Harlots, wandring, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the World; yet in the midſt of all thoſe ſquandrings, God gave him a good and holy Conſideration of remembring his Father, and a Reſolution to return penitently to ſeek him. This wretch went aſtray, 'tis true, but yet he gave; he ruined himſelf, but he relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others. If he ſinned in giving ill, yet there was ſomething good wrought in that giving ill; namely, to give, to ſuccour, and to ſuſtain thoſe that wanted. If he offended
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:98258:180"/>God in ſinning, yet he imitated God in giving at leaſt; for God gives not only to the good, but alſo to the evil; and to give, though with ſquandring to the bad, was an evil not totally void of good.</p>
                     <p>The unjuſt Steward, that leſſened the Debts to his Maſter's coſt, to paſs them ſo afterwards in his Accounts, did very ill; but yet he gave, and the Lord commended him, as having done wiſely, and puts him for an Example, that we ſhould make Friends of the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Mammon,</hi> that is, of Money ill-gotten, and that we ſhould get out of that wickedneſs, by giving, when we cannot find the Perſon to whom it ſhould be reſtor'd; but the Covetous Man, that had ſo many Barns, and yet in his thought was fooliſhly contriving to build more and greater ones, to hoard up the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Corn, was himſelf caſt into Hell, as a bundle of Tares: And the other Rich Glutton, who would not give ſo much as the broken ſcraps of his Gluttony to feed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Beggar, that lay at his Door, was alſo for ever condemned; there being amongſt the evil they did, nothing that was good, for Pity to lay hold on.</p>
                     <p>And thus it is ill to be Prodigal, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ill to be Covetous. The good thing is to be Liberal, and a giver of Alms; yet of the two extreams, he is the leſs evil (with equal imperfection) that gives, than he that refuſes; He that throws away, than he that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and he that waſtes, than he that ſpares.</p>

                     <p>With Humility and Liberality thou oughteſt to love Chaſtity, the inward and the outward Cloathing, which cleanſes and beautifies the Conſcience, and adorns the Soul with a white Garment, ſweetly perfumed, and very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Lord's Eyes. A Vertue beloved of our Saviour and his Mother, and one of thoſe he ſhew'd moſt kindneſs to; Jeſus being a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin himſelf, would have a Virgin-Mother, and a Virgin-Father, in her Husband <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Virgin-Fore-runner in the
<hi>Baptiſt,</hi> a Virgin-Diſciple in St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and even in Heaven Virginity had its firſt birth in the Angelical Nature.</p>
                     <p>O Heavenly Virginity! O Soveraign Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! O un-utterable Chaſtity, which dwelleſt in Heaven, and wert a Vertue there before thou wert known upon Earth! O Heavenly Virginity, which waiteſt upon the Virgin-Lamb, who is accompanied by Virgins, that follow him whitherſoever he goeth! O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Virginity, which art the fruit of the Blood of the Lamb, ſince it is that Wine which engendreth Virgins.</p>
                     <p>Virginity and Chaſtity purifie the Soul, and which is more admirable, preſerve the Body alſo pure, white, and ſpotleſs. Chaſtity makes the Spirit pure, clean, and fervent. Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſpoſes the Will to give itſelf wholly up to God, and not to love the Creatures, nor to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:98258:181"/>forſake the Creator for them. Chaſtity keeps the Powers, Faculties, and Senſes clean, to the end that being pure, chaſt, and diſ-enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, we may forſake all Creatures, freely ſeeking after the Creator. Chaſtity betroths itſelf to Vertue, protects and defends it, and obliges the Eternal Son of God, and his Holy Mother, with all the Saints and Angels to be our Friends. Finally, wouldſt thou ſee the excellency of Chaſtity? Look upon its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, Luſt and Senſuality. Wouldſt thou know the beauty of Light? Conſider the ugly and loathſome horror of Darkneſs. Theſe defile, embaſe, and make deformed; whereas the other clears, adorns, and beautifies.</p>

                     <head>The Miſchiefs of Senſuality.</head>
                     <p>Senſuality depraves the Senſes, defiles the powers of the Soul, diſorders all our Faculties, deſtroys all our Rational part, and reduces us to be meerly Animal. Senſuality obſcures Reaſon, and makes Paſſion tyrannize over it. Other Vices do beſpot the Soul, this the Soul and Body too. The reſt are Vices and Paſſions of Diſcourſe, this is a beaſtly Paſſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Bruits, that are not able to Diſcourſe. The Proud, the Ambitious, and the Covetous have ſomething of Reaſon in them. In thoſe Vices ſomething of Diſcourſe is requiſite; and that Natural elation and vanity of the Mind ſpeaks Superiority; but the Baſe, Laſcivious, and Senſual Perſon, is very ſhort and ſottiſh
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98258:181"/>in his Diſcourſing, being totally ſenſual and beſtial; and agrees ſo much the more with Beaſts, by how much the more he is Brutiſh and Animal in his unbridled Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Who is able to number the Ruins this Vice hath cauſed? It is eaſier to lament, than to reckon them. See what it brought upon
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> It made that Heavenly Man become an Adulterer, a Murtherer, Treacherous, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and Cruel to a worthy and valiant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. From the ill Example of the Father, it paſs'd on to the Inceſtuous Son, and made
<hi>Amnon</hi> to force his Siſter <hi>Thamar:</hi> Next it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<hi>Abſalom</hi> to take Revenge by killing his Brother <hi>Amnon:</hi> Thence proceeded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, when his Subjects ſaw themſelves commanded by an Adulterous, Murthering, and Treacherous King. Thence came a general Scandal, and thence the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom rebelled, and the poor deſpiſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted King was fain to fly from his own Son, bewailing the Sin he had committed, the lives of an innumerable company of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being paid for one Senſual Delight. Now if we have often imitated
<hi>David</hi> in ſinning, let us imitate him alſo in repenting. Let our Tears remedy that Miſchief, and let our Grief and Contrition help to make amends for our follies of Laſciviouſneſs, and let our Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the Offence, which by luſtful looking upon Beauty they have committed. Let Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cure the heart that is wounded by that Paſſion, and let the warning of ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98258:182"/>make him Wiſe, Chaſt, and Wary, who has been made Fooliſh, Senſual, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate by the pleaſure of a moment.</p>
                     <p>What Ruines and Misfortunes, what Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Deſolations does not the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> owe to this Senſual Vice? It was above nine hundred Years under the Chain of an hard Captivity, purging away the guilt of one ſin haſtily committed, but long and ſharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Look upon the Senſuality of the laſt King of the
<hi>Goths,</hi> how it made an end of his Empire, threw down his Power to the ground, drew Barbarians into <hi>Spain,</hi> baniſhed the Faith out of it, filled it with Infidelity, and quite rooted out the Valour and Goodneſs of the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Nation. Finally, one momentany De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light coſt the loſs of an innumerable company of Lives and Souls. This Example is of a Neighbour-Nation, but the like Cauſes will probably produce the like Effects in other places; many Inſtances whereof may be found in the Hiſtories of all Countries, to the end that great Perſons chiefly may take warning, becauſe their evil deeds are of more dangerous conſequence, in the influence they have upon the Guilt and Puniſhment of others in this World; but as to the other World, even the meaneſt are as nearly concerned to fly this Vice, for the conſequence of it to them will be the rottenneſs of their Bodies, and the damnation of their Souls, (which is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) unleſs God give them the Grace to Repent, and forſake ſo ruinous a Vice.</p>

                     <head>Of Remedies againſt Senſuality.</head>
                     <p>But what Remedy is there againſt ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Miſchiefs? God and the ſerious thought of him is the principal Remedy; Prayer and begging earneſtly of God to cleanſe us, and give
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98258:183"/>us Chaſtity. This is the only remedy, ſince it is certain, that no man can be chaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of God; <hi>Nemo enim continens eſſe poterit, niſi Deus dederit;</hi> Pray therefore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually that God would defend thy Soul from this Vice, and give thee an hatred of it. But together with this, which is the principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, there are others which God applies to free us from that inbred and Domeſtick Evil. And the firſt is the Protection and Interceſſion of Chriſt, with his holy Example, and thy endeavour to imitate the Purity of his Life; for if thou prayeſt, and acteſt contrary to thy Prayers, thou provokeſt him to anger, that ſhould grant thy requeſt; and if thou wilt have the chaſt and holy Jeſus to be thy Maſter, thou muſt ſhew thy ſelf to be his Diſciple, by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to follow him in holineſs and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>Next this Remedy, (and even in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) avoid the occaſions of looſing thy Chaſtity. Truſt not in thy ſelf, nor preſume upon thine own ſtrength, but believe thou ſhalt no longer be ſav'd from falling, than thou keepeſt thy ſelf from the occaſion of falling. Think how is it poſſible to have live Coals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Breaſt and not be burnt? Think, how is it poſſible that fire and tow ſhould touch one another without being enflamed. Think how is it poſſible to dawb thy ſelf with Pitch, and not be defiled. Conſider, I ſay, that there is as little poſſibility to eſcape ſafe from a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and very near occaſion. If thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap'd<pb n="339" facs="tcp:98258:183"/>to day, it is in a manner a Miracle, and it is ten thouſand to one, that thou ſhalt fall miſerably to morrow, if thou preſume to venture upon it again, and ſhalt fall ſo much more fouly and irrecoverably, by how much the more thou art confident, that thou ſhalt not. Let not thy Paſſion, nor thy fooliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption deceive thee; thou art not holier than <hi>David,</hi> nor wiſer than <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than <hi>Sampſon;</hi> and yet all theſe fell by not avoiding the occaſions, and theſe were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick warnings, which God hath left to the World, to the end we may open our Eyes, and be more wary.</p>
                     <p>Art thou a Spiritual Perſon, and doſt not avoid the occaſions of ſin? Why then, thou art not a Spiritual Perſon. Thinkeſt thou, becauſe thou liveſt upon thy guard, thou ſhalt not fall? If thou truſteſt to that, thou art fallen already, unleſs thou alſo liveſt retired. Sometimes, nay often, a Spiritual Perſon, that expoſes himſelf to voluntary occaſions, (if he may be called Spiritual that does ſo) is in greater danger of falling than a looſe and debauched man; for the looſe man incurs leſs danger, becauſe he incurs more; and the cautious perſon probably incurs more, becauſe he incurs leſs. How is this? you'l ſay, I do not underſtand it. Then I will explain it to thee. The Laſcivious man by cuſtom in that Vice, ſometimes looſes his Appetite, or at leaſt abates it, and with that the Temptation; but it encreaſes with the cautious man, and becomes more ardent by<pb n="340" facs="tcp:98258:184"/>his forbearance, and therefore the Tempter is more ſollicitous, vigilant, and vehement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him. The Delights wherewith the Devil entices a Spiritual Man, are in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and have nothing of act, whereby he may become undeceived; but thoſe of the Vicious Man are filthy in his practiſe of them, and that very filthineſs and foulneſs tires him, enlightens him, and undeceives him; for this reaſon Spiritual Perſons ought to be more watchful and wary than thoſe, that are Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual; and if not, they will do as the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who ended in the Fleſh, having begun in the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>In Concluſion, would'ſt thou be chaſt, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wary? Would'ſt thou conquer this Vice? Then fly from it. Other ſins are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by fighting, this by flying. This flight is both the Combat, the Victory, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; but withal uſe Abſtinence, and other acts of Mortification, to overcome and ſubdue ſo powerful a Paſſion. There is a ſort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſaith our Saviour, that <hi>cannot be cast out without Faſting and Prayer.</hi> To eat much, and to drink much, and neither to think of God, nor call upon him in Prayer, is not the way to conquer that ſtrong, contagious, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Paſſion. It is frail, and needs ſtrong Remedies. It is incontinent, and needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Remedies. It is unruly and unbridled, and therefore needs Remedies that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and tame it. By Abſtinence thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alſo conquer Gluttony, the foul ugly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98258:184"/>of many ſins. The ancient Philoſophers, though they had but the Light of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which is Natural Reaſon, yet ſaid very excellently, That a Vertuous Life conſiſted wholly in two words,
<hi>Suſtine &amp; Abſtine,</hi> Bear and Forbear, or be patient and abſtemious. If a Heathen could ſay ſo by the Light of his Candle, What ſhall a Spiritual Man ſay, being enlightened by the Sun of Chriſtian Verities, and by the Rays of Eternal and Celeſtial Light? Abſtinence is an Univerſal Vertue, which comprehends innumerable Vertues; and ſo this Vertue alone is a general Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Maladies of a Spiritual Life.</p>
                     <p>Would'ſt thou not ſin? Why then abſtain from offending God by the breach of his holy Commandments. Would'ſt thou grow in the Internal Life? Why then, abſtain from reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy Counſels. Would'ſt thou have the Vertues come and lodge within thee? Why then, abſtain from running into Vice. Would'ſt thou be perfect in all things? Why then faſt inwardly, as well as outwardly. Would'ſt thou ſubdue thy Vices? Encompaſs thy ſelf with the Vertues, for that is the Girdle, which our Saviour tells us is the Scourge of Vice. What good doth it to begirt the Body with a Cord, and make it lean with faſting; if in the mean while the Soul grow big, and ſwell up with Self-will. What good does the yellow meager Countenance, which ſpeaks abſtinence from Meat and Drink; if in the mean while wrath and hatred give a worſe Complexion to the<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98258:185"/>Soul, becauſe they feed it with a worſe Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment? <hi>In the midſt of your Fast,</hi> ſays God, <hi>your own Will reigns, whereas the reſigning it up to my Will ought to be the Crown and Honour of your Fast.</hi> This is another kind of Abſtinence than that which is contrary to Gluttony; but I will now ſay ſomething of that.</p>

                     <p>Gluttony is an infamous Vice, that pollutes and deſtroys both Body and Soul no leſs, than Senſuality, dulling and abaſing the Senſes of the one, and the Powers of the other.

Conſider what Patience he had need to have, who is perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, by the World, by the Fleſh, by the Devil, and by his own ſelf.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Spiritual Life is a fruitful Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot of Thorns, and the way of Afflictions; and therefore it is neceſſary at every ſtep to have the Staff of Patience in thy hand to ſupport thee. Is it not the way of the Croſs? Why then have Patience. Is it not the way of Difficulties? Why then have Patience. Is it not a way of Tribulations? Why then have Patience. By this one Vertue alone many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are deſtroyed. Without Patience thou<pb n="346" facs="tcp:98258:187"/>would'ſt throw the Croſs from thy ſhoulders, and run over to the Party of thy Enemies, which are thy Delights and the Devils; for this reaſon the Lord recommended Patience to his Diſciples above all other Vertues, ſaying, <hi>In patience poſſeſs your Souls.</hi> He ſent them out as Lambs into the midſt of Wolves; he ſent them to preach, teach, and to give light to a fooliſh, perverſe, and a wicked World; what could they look for, but Pains, Croſſes, Death, and Torments? And how ſhould they be able to make any advantage of them, without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Suffering? In another place he tells us, <hi>That the good bring forth fruit in patience;</hi> as inferring, That without Patience there is no Fruit at all of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>This is moſt certain, That the Vertues, how many ſoever they be, can neither conſiſt with one another, nor have any Life, Subſiſtence, or Perſeverance in themſelves, without Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And reaſon ſhews it, for all of them make it their buſineſs to ſubdue the Appetite, and to give Reaſon her Sceptre and Empire. The Appetite reſiſts, and deſires Superiority: Reaſon on the other ſide ſights and makes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſo that to hold out ſuch a cruel, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, continual, and internal War, there is a neceſſity of having a great deal of Patience. Affronts, Calumnies, and Perſecutions aſſault the Spiritual Man; What other Remedy has he but Patience? He walks with Temptations round about him; What Remedy is there but Patience? He falls into Imperfections and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98258:187"/>and the Enemy tempts him to Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, What other Remedy but Patience? Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Humility, Conſtancy, and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which are all Siſters, do crown the Soul, and make it triumphant in the Spiritual Life.</p>
                     <p>What elſe was the Life of Chriſt, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Example, but a long, conſtant, repeated, and enlarged Patience? Behold him ſuffering cold in the Manger, the ſmart of a Knife in Circumciſion, heat and wearineſs in his flying to <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſlanders, revilings, and inſolencies from ſome Miniſters of the Law in his Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, Scourging, Thorns, Wounds, Death, and the Croſs in his Paſſion. In all this he conſecrated Patience, and the ſame Vertue was practis'd by his Mother in the Torments of her Son, ſuffering in her tender heart what our Lord ſuffered in his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>What Complaints were heard from our ſweet Maſter Jeſus? O the innumerable Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that were done him! But what reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did he ſhew? Why, to teach, to give light, to guide, to ſuffer, to entreat, and to pray for his Enemies. Patience is not only a Merit, and a Merit of very great excellency; but it is Comfort, Peace, and Joy, and very great Wiſdom. <hi>Who is the Wiſe man?</hi> ſays one of the Fathers of the Church, and anſwers that doubt, <hi>The Patient man.</hi> And who is more wiſe? He that is more Patient. And who is the wiſeſt of all? He that is moſt Patient of all.</p>

                     <head>Of Anger.</head>
                     <p>Believe me, Anger is an ugly, fierce, ignorant, and unruly Vice; for it vexes, afflicts, diſquiets, precipitates, and works nothing but confuſion, coming very ſhort in Means and in Remedies. Patience will free thee from all this; for it enlarges the Heart, encreaſes the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gives ſtrength and depth to our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. What doſt thou think that Anger is but a ſhort madneſs? for the angry man and the mad man differ only in time, not in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The furious mad man is angry for a long time, and the furious angry man is mad for a ſhort time. Would'ſt thou ſee the Picture of Anger? Look in a Glaſs when thou art angry, and thou ſhalt ſee a terrible uglineſs in thy Face; thine Eyes ſparkle with rage, thy Brows wrinkled with Frowns, thy Complexion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd and enflam'd with redneſs, and all thy actions ſudden and diſorder'd. What a kind of thing is Anger in the Soul, which thus transforms the Countenance, and deformes the whole Perſon?</p>
                     <p>The Lord in that holy Precept of loving E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, had an Eye not only to the good of the Enemy, and the Perſon hated; but alſo to that of the Friend, by whom he would have him to be loved. His aim was not only, that the one ſhould not die, but alſo that the other might live; and which is more, he deſir'd not only to prevent a Chriſtian from defiling his Soul with hatred; but alſo to preſerve him from the vexation and torment of ſo unquiet<pb n="349" facs="tcp:98258:188"/>a Paſſion. His intent in this moſt ſweet and gentle Precept, was to give the Chriſtian a Temporal, as well as an Eternal Life. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal by his obedience, and Temporal by his quiet. To hate is rage, diſquiet, anguiſh, and death, and ſo he baniſhed Anger from the Soul, to free it from death, anguiſh, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
                     <p>Doſt thou think that by thy hatred thou takeſt revenge upon thine Enemy? Thou art deceived; it is he that is revenged on thee. What greater puniſhment can thy Enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon thee, than that to which thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelf meerly by thy hatred? Thou fretteſt, thou ſtormeſt, thou vexeſt, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteſt thy ſelf; thou abhorreſt on the one ſide, and longeſt eagerly on the other, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in a continual Affliction, between the earneſtneſs of thy Deſires and Averſions; toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and turning to and fro, biting thy Lips, grinding thy Teeth, and contriving Scorpions for another; but all this within thine own heart. What Torture can the Enemy give thee, that is greater, nay equal to this that thou bringeſt upon thy ſelf? On the contrary, he very often laughs when thou lamenteſt; and he is at reſt when thou art upon the rack. By this it is manifeſt, that 'tis more eaſie, more cheerful, more pleaſant and delightful for thee to love, than to hate thine Enemy. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, it is not only pleaſing to God, but happy and comfortable to our ſelves to love our enemies. According to this patience, the medicine<pb n="350" facs="tcp:98258:189"/>of Anger is not bitter, but ſweet; and the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſician cures thee of a Calenture in the Dog-days, by preſcribing thee a draught of Cold water; for he cures the Infernal fire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and waſhes it away with the gentle Stream of Love and Charity. For this reaſon we may juſtly call Patience the Celeſtial Art of Peace. Would'ſt thou have Peace, and Joy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in thy Soul? Get Patience, and thou ſhalt have Peace, and by having Peace and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou ſhalt not only have Joy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but the Author of Patience and Peace, of Joy and Comfort, ſhall dwell continually in thy Soul.</p>

                     <p>There is yet another kind of Abſtinence, beſides that excellent Vertue of forbearing the Exceſs of Meat and Drink, which we have already ſpoken of; which is that of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuperfluous and hurtful Talk; for that is alſo a very admirable and profitable kind of Abſtinence. I do not know, whether I ſhould not ſay; Thou ſhalt do a better and a greater thing, to abſtain from ſpeaking much, than eating much; for ſpeaking cauſes more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs than eating, and men grow tir'd and weary with eating, but never with talking. Our Saviour doth advertiſe us well of this, when he ſays, <hi>Not that which enters into the Mouth defiles the Soul, but that which comes out of</hi>

                        <hi>the Mouth.</hi> Now they be words which come out of the Mouth, and it is meat that goeth into the Mouth; What then, Is not exceſſive eating very hurtful? Yes to the Body; but the Soul receives no hurt from the meat, but from the exceſſive delight in it; whereas that, whereby the Soul is ſo frequently defiled, comes out of the mouth, in filthy, looſe, ſmutty, and ſinful words, as alſo in thoſe that ſlander, and detract, and deſtroy the Honours, Lives, and Fortunes of their Neighbours. Theſe are they commonly that do the miſchief to our Souls.</p>
                     <p>The Tongue is the Source of Vice, and the Ruiner of Vertue. This little Inſtrument is a ſharp and cruel Razour, that cuts, and burns, and kills, and ſets the whole World on fire, and is ſet on fire of Hell. St. <hi>James</hi> calls it <hi>an unruly Member, full of deadly poyſon,</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infinite vexations, quarrels, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it diſturbs, diſquiets, and overturns all. In ſhort, this little Engine is the univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, through which all the miſchiefs of the World come out of the heart, in counſelling, perſwading, diſpoſing, and quickning its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 'Tis not without great reaſon, that God hath ſhut up this dangerous and powerful Inſtrument, the Tongue, within a double wall of the Teeth, and of the Lips, to the end that it might be kept cloſe and reſtrained; and no words ſuffered to paſs out of that Fortreſs, till they be well examined. One Bridle is enough for the fierceſt Horſe, but for this little Worm<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98258:190"/>two are not ſufficient. Think what a ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Houſe that is, which needs two Porters; either it is in a very unſafe Condition, or elſe the keeping of it is of great importance.</p>
                     <p>Be very wary of thy Speech, and keep thy ſelf, as much as thou canſt towards ſilence, for that is very ſecure; but ſpeaking, very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous to thy Soul. Think, ruminate, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and file over thy words oftentimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou utter them with thy Tongue; and conſider that when once they come there, and are ſhot from thence, they become Arrows, which cannot be recalled, and which kill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. <hi>The Tongue</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>being in a dark moiſt place, is very apt to ſlip, and it is very dangerous to go in ſlippery places without either light or care.</hi>

                  <head>Of Envy.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <p>ABſtinence, Patience, and Silence are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally followed by the Love of our Neighbour, whereof the contrary is Envy, an infamous Vice, which took birth, growth, and gathered ſtrength with our very Nature; but I come ſhort, Envy is more ancient than our Nature; for <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Fellows ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Heaven by Envy, and fell headlong from thence into the bottomleſs Pit. It being propos'd to that high Cherubim, (according to the Opinion of grave Authors) that he ſhould adore the Eternal Son of God, when in future time he ſhould be united to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he diſdained to do it through Envy, that an Union ſhould be made with the Humane, when he might have taken the Angelical.</p>
                     <p>It was Pride in <hi>Lucifer</hi> not to adore the Son of God; but it was a Pride (according to this Opinion) that had its Root in Envy. It was Envy alſo that moved him afterwards in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> to lay that Trap, into which our innocent Parents fell, alluring their holy ſincerity and goodneſs with offers of being like unto Gods. It was his Envy to ſee them in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Eternal Creator, while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was Condemned into Everlaſting Fire.<pb n="355" facs="tcp:98258:191"/>It was Envy that in the firſt ſteps of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of our firſt Parents, made angry
<hi>Cain</hi> an Enemy to God, and to his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and which made him firſt commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then to Deſpair, and at laſt to be quite cut off; that Envy proceeding from God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable accepting of the Sacrifice of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and turning away his Eyes from that of the Covetous. This wild Beaſt within his heart, broke out into open Fury, and was the firſt that ſhed Humane Blood, and the firſt that put the Life and Death of the Innocent into the power of the Guilty. This was the firſt wickedneſs, that after their own Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, afflicted our firſt Parents, and the Tears, Grief, and Repentance for their own Offence, were much encreaſed in ſeeing the Murder of their good and holy Son, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the hand of the other, that was a wretched Villain and a Caſt-away.</p>
                     <p>It was Envy that ſowed innumerable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords between thoſe firſt Patriarchs and Heads of the ſeveral Tribes;
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren not being able to endure his Vertues, nor the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Father to him, they reſolved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſell him, than to imitate him. It was Envy that brought in the Diſſentions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the elder not being able to ſuffer the Bleſſing of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It was Envy that took away the Vertue, the Kingdom, and the Life of <hi>Saul,</hi> who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not bear the Valour and the Spirit of <hi>David,</hi> choſe rather utterly to deſtroy<pb n="356" facs="tcp:98258:192"/>him than frame himſelf to follow his Example. It was Envy alſo that durſt attempt to bite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Apoſtles themſelves, when ſeeing the favour of their Maſter to St. <hi>John,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtrive which of them ſhould be the greateſt. It was Envy that was the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive, that kindled the fire of Rage and Paſſion in the hearts of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and of the Prieſts and Maſters of the Law againſt Jeſus, when ſeeing his Vertues and Miracles, they choſe rather to put him to Death, than to enjoy Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>Behold the Victories and Trophies of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and entertain a great abhorrence of this cruel Enemy; for it is a powerful one, though in it ſelf it be vile, baſe, and infamous; choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to hate Vertue, than to emulate it, and affecting priority, rather by deſtroying that which is good, than by making that good which is evil.</p>
                     <p>It is an infamous, a deſperate, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Vice; for the firſt, that it kills, is the Perſon who entertains it, and the Envious man dies with Envy himſelf, but cannot thereby kill the Perſon envied. It is an infamous Vice, for that being able to eaſe it ſelf (in a great meaſure) of vexation, by imitating Vertue; it frees it ſelf rather by the deſtruction and death of the innocent and vertuous Perſon, making Poyſon of the Antidote, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by the vertue of another. It is an infamous Vice, becauſe it draws the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hatred and abhorrence out of the<pb n="357" facs="tcp:98258:192"/>ſame ground, from whence it ought to draw that of Love to Vertue; and it defames and diſhonours that which right Reaſon extols and magnifies. It is an infamous Vice, becauſe it deſtroys the love of our Nature; for whereas one man ought to love another as man, and much more if he be vertuous, Envy abhors him ſo much for being vertuous, that it would not ſuffer him to continue man. It is an infamous Vice, becauſe it proſecutes the damage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without bringing any profit to it ſelf, and loads it ſelf with more Crimes, without leſſening anothers Vertues. It is an infamous Vice, becauſe it makes an Enemy of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom it ought to imitate and eſteem as a Friend, chooſing rather to abhor that which is good, than to make uſe of it in forſaking that which is evil. Finally, Envy is the Vice of baſe wretched People; for whereas the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man might by a noble emulation and ſincere endeavour, make himſelf both vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and generous, he chooſes rather to torment himſelf, and become more baſe, more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more miſerable.</p>

                     <head>Remedies againſt Envy.</head>
                     <p>This Vice muſt be cured by means contrary to thoſe we directed againſt Senſuality, for that (as we ſaid) muſt be cured by flight, but Envy muſt be conquered by fighting. Thus when thou feeleſt in thy heart the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards Envy, raiſe up thy ſelf to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<pb n="358" facs="tcp:98258:193"/>it with a ſtout Oppoſition, and force thy ſelf to love and praiſe that Perſon, whom it would tempt thee to abhor and to calumniate. Let both thy words and thy thoughts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that Perſon, whom thou art troubled to ſee preferred before thee. Exalt his fame, and copy his vertues with thy utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of men in the World, which are very great in my eſteem; thoſe that acknowledge the ill which is in themſelves; and thoſe that acknowledge the good which is in their Enemies. It is a generous ſenſe, and a noble action for a man to conquer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and to own Vertue whereſoever he finds it. That is a powerful and a generous light which illuminates the Soul, and drives away the darkneſs of Envy; and a Man will not be far from imitating the vertue of a perſon whom he rightly underſtands to be vertuous.</p>
                     <p>What doſt thou gain by Envy, but rage, anguiſh, and the gnawing of thy own bowels? He enjoys all his happineſs, and thou chooſeſt torments and vexations. If Envy could take away the good things of the perſon envied; if it could bring home his Riches and Honours to the Houſe of the envious man, though with the adding of Theft to his Envy, yet at leaſt he would get ſome profit by it, and have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to comfort himſelf in the midſt of his tortures. But it is not ſo; for the envied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remains healthful, happy, rich, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and the envious man poor, afflicted,<pb n="359" facs="tcp:98258:193"/>wretched, and miſerable; getting nothing of the Wealth he envies, but of the colour of that Gold in his Complexion.</p>
                     <p>Better thy Fortune by thy Vertues, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempt to advance it by Vices. Do that which is in thy power, which is to imitate whatſoever is good, and fly from whatſoever is evil; and ſtrive not in vain to do what is above thy power, namely, to take away the goodneſs from him that is good by making thy ſelf wicked, and by torturing thy Soul with continual diſquiets.</p>

                     <p>Charity towards our Neighbours is the bridle of Envy, the total deſtruction of it. With this thou muſt baniſh that out of thy heart. Love to our Neighbours is a Ray of the Divine Love; for Man imitates God in loving that which he loved, that is to ſay, Man, for whom he died. If we love not our Neighours, whom will we love? Will we perhaps love the wild brute Beaſt? We are Humane by Nature, let us be Humane alſo in our Love. Who is there that abhors himſelf? or who is there that abhors his own Natural Condition?</p>
                     <p>Our Nature has produced ſo Savage a Beaſt, ſo pitileſs a Man, and ſo great an Enemy to Mankind, that kiſſing a Child, and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed why?

                        <hi>and for that reaſon he began to love him.</hi> This Man, or rather this Monſter of Cruelty, would for the ſame cauſe have kiſſed the Plague, if he had met it in the Street. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like this, that was alſo a great Enemy to Mankind, and they two viſiting one another, the firſt ſaid, <hi>I am very glad to be in the Company of one that abhors Men;</hi> To which the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>So ſhould I alſo to be in thine, but that thou art a Man.</hi> Were theſe Men? No certainly, but Beaſts, and fiercer than Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Redeemer did not thus, but was always pleaſed to be called Man; and being God, the Eternal Son of God, God of God, ſeldom or never called himſelf the Son of God, but often the Son of Man, honouring that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he came to Redeem, and making himſelf Man, by taking his Name from it.</p>

                        <hi>Love thy Nature,</hi> ſays the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>hate</hi> not thine own Fleſh. If Men abhor Men, and which is more, Men that are vertuous (for that is it which Envy commonly abhors) who ſhall love Men, or reward Vertue? He is no true Chriſtian that abhors Men through Envy or Cruelty? for he follows not the principal Vertue which Jeſus Chriſt did practiſe. God being Divine became Humane, and being God, cloathed himſelf with our Nature, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man; and canſt thou abhor thine own Nature, or at leaſt a Man?

How meek!<pb n="361" facs="tcp:98258:194"/>how gentle! how favourable! how ſweet and gracious towards all Men!</p>

                     <p>And this he did amongſt other things, to teach us not only Humility, but even Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, Humanity, and Civility, as Beams of that Charity; for that Infinite Love beſtowed and communicated himſelf on that manner, with his very Humanity. The Saviour of Souls condemns any one that ſhall be rude and diſcourteous, or that ſhall call his Brother
<hi>Raca,</hi> which in the Opinion of grave Expoſitors, ſignifies a manner of diſcourteous and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Behaviour; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo makes Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie an holy and a Sacred thing, counſelling that in honour we ſhould prefer one another, <hi>Honore ſe invicem praevenientes;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, be Courteous, and prevent one another in Civility, or ſtrive each of you to be the firſt in Courteſie.</p>
                     <p>Think not that Humanity and kind: Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is a ſlight matter in the Spiritual Life. No; it is of great weight, and of much worth.
<hi>When thou art invited,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>ſit not down in the chiefeſt place, leaſt a more honourable than thou come, and thou be forc'd with ſhame to take the lower Room.</hi> Thou ſhould'ſt ſtrive to be Courteous and Civil; for it is a great good to thy ſelf, and very pleaſing to others. Thy love of God cannot be great, if it make thee not ſhew thy ſelf meek and courteous towards<pb n="362" facs="tcp:98258:195"/>Men. That has but a very ſmall force which cannot break forth through the thickneſs of four fingers, and that is as much as the diſtance can be from thy heart to the outſide of thy breaſt. If thy love of God be a true love, it is not poſſible thou ſhould'ſt forbear to love his Creatures; and thou wilt do it ſo much the more, by how much the more the love of God is pure and perfect in thee. In the ſame proportion that thy love of God increaſes, thy love to thy Neighbours will increaſe likewiſe; and in the ſame proportion the one waſts and decays, the other ceaſes and vaniſhes alſo. If God, who is love it ſelf, do love Man, how can a Man that loves God forbear to love Man, and to deſire his good? The love of God to Man appeared before his Divine Majeſty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; his love being uncreate and eternal in it ſelf, though in reſpect of its manifeſtation to Mankind it had a beginning.</p>
                     <p>That loving Apoſtle, the glory of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the beloved Evangeliſt, and the adopted Son of the moſt bleſſed Virgin, wrote an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle perſwading to the love of God, and of Men; and being grown ſo old that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were fain to carry him in their Arms, all his Sermon was, <hi>Little Children, love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> All we Men are Sons by Grace of one ſame Father, which is God; and Sons by Baptiſm of one ſame Mother, which is the Church. We are all made by one ſame Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; all redeemed by one ſame Price, which is the Blood of Chriſt; and all nouriſhed by<pb n="363" facs="tcp:98258:195"/>one ſame Milk, which is his moſt holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and admirable Sacraments. And is it poſſible that ſo many Bonds and Obligations ſhould not tye Man cloſe to Man, nor make them love and help one another? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Wrath, Paſſion, and Envy ſhould break all theſe Obligations? No, No. Love Humane Nature, for though it were not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf, yet it being created by God, it becomes noble, and is illuſtrious by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, honoured, and favoured by his moſt precious Son. That which coſt much is of great value; but the repairing of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture coſt the Blood of the Eternal Son of God. He cloathed himſelf with it, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured us alſo by it. God Created Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own Likeneſs; Who will not eſteem Man for being the Image of God? And the more, becauſe God afterwards, by becoming Man, made himſelf the Image of Man.</p>

                  <head>Of Diligence and Fervency, and of the Miſchiefs of Omiſſion and Sloth.</head>
                  <p>THE Vertues help forward one another; The love of God will guide thee to that of Men. This love will bring thee to ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and fervency will open the Gate to zeal, and zeal for the good of thy Neighbours, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Charity both for them and for thy ſelf, will open thee the Gate of Heaven. This fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and this love will not ſuffer thee to be lazy and ſleepy; for ſleep is no uſual Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Lovers. Charity and Sloth cannot dwell together in one breaſt. To ſleep much, and to love much, are not things conſiſtent. <hi>My Father always worketh,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and I work.</hi> What wonder is it that the Father and the Son ſhould always be working, ſince through the Holy Ghoſt they are always lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?</p>
                  <p>There can be no ſuch thing as a lazy Spritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon; for ſo much as he hath of ſloth, ſo much he wanteth of being ſpiritual. Love is full of an holy diſquiet. It is a ſweet longing and refreſhing; and if it be afire, how can i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs and ſloth be in ſo active and ſtirring an Element?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:98258:196"/>Fly from ſloth in the Spiritual Life; fly from it, I ſay, for it is a great and terrible Evil. <hi>Go learn of the Ant,</hi> ſays the Holy Spirit to the ſluggard. Judge what the Vice is, and what the Perſon is that is infected with it, who needs to be taught by ſo contemptible a Maſter; and how much more wretched and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible is the Scholar? Sloth ſtupifies the Senſes, dulls the powers of the Soul, puts ſhackles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Faculties, and by little and little ſtrips the Spiritual Man quite naked, and leaves him meerly natural and ſenſual. Sloth is the Mother of Omiſſion, and Omiſſion is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the ruin of us. Doſt thou ſee all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that is in the World? It all proceeds and takes birth from the Omiſſion of good. Doſt thou ſee the World to be full of wickedneſs? It ever ſprings and grows up in idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>How well did he, that beat the Maſter, when he ſaw the Scholars loitering in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence! he juſtly puniſhed that defect, even by falling into ſome exceſs. If Omiſſion of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours did not foment the neglect and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe under their Government, there is no doubt, but they would be reformed. I ſleep, and while I am ſleeping, thoſe under my charge are ruined waking. My ſleep becomes their death, and my ſloth and remiſneſs their utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>God deliver me and thee from thoſe Vices which conſiſt in not doing; for they have a face and outſide of Innocence, but within their Bowels they are full of innumerable Crimes,<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98258:197"/>ſince they cheriſh all thoſe which they do not correct. God in judging us, though he will judge us for every ſin, yet I obſerve that the Articles of Accuſation at that high Tribunal are all of Omiſſion. <hi>I was hungry, and thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me no meat; I was thirſty, and thou gaveſt me nothing to drink; naked, and thou didſt not cloathe me; ſick and in priſon, and thou viſitedſt me not.</hi> But Lord! Are there not other ſins of Commiſſion? Doſt thou only Charge us with thoſe of Omiſſion? Are there not a thouſand wickedneſſes and beaſtly filthineſſes, as well as heinous Cruelties committed? And doſt thou only take notice of Perfections and Vertues not performed? But what if this be meant of that part of the Univerſal Judgment which concerns the Heads and Governours of this World, as well Secular as Eccleſiaſtical, and that God intimates that the ſins of Commiſſion of their Subjects are included in thoſe of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Superiours, and that in judging theſe he alſo condemns thoſe?</p>
                  <p>What if the Eternal Judge, finding the World ruined by their neglecting to do their duty, condemns the wilful ſins of the one ſort in the careleſs ſins of the other? What if he judges Idleneſs, as being the Mother of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes? and ſentences the debauched and diſſolute Sons, in the lazy and careleſs Fathers, they being thereby the Root of their Vices? I know not how that will be, but this I can tell thee, that thou oughteſt to ſhun Sloth and Omiſſion, as the fruitful Seed-plot of Vices and<pb n="367" facs="tcp:98258:197"/>Wickedneſs of all ſorts. Take notice of, and hearken to thoſe Reproofs that our Lord gives to the Maſters of the Law, and thou ſhalt ſee that all of them tend and are directed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe Heads, becauſe in them conſiſted the deſtruction of the Members, but he almoſt always favoured and protected the Multitude; he bore with them, he fed them, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them, he wrought Miracles to give them food, both Spiritual and Corporal. And what, Were there not many wicked among thoſe common People? Yes, no doubt there were, but they were common People. But againſt the Maſters of the Law, who ſlept in their Vices; againſt the High Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees, who had placed the Tables of the Law among the Tables and Coffers of their Covetouſneſs, and who left off Preaching and Teaching, to the end that in the mean while they themſelves might be left, and aſſiſted to rob and ſteal; againſt theſe his Reprehenſions were moſt vehement and ſevere. He called them Serpents, Generation of Vipers, Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres full of Corruption, Sons even of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf; and finally in this the meekneſs of the Lord was turned into Zeal, Juſtice, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                  <p>If the Preacher paſs over ſins in ſilence, how ſhall the ſinful hearer ever come to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If the Confeſſor diſſemble, how ſhall the Penitent ever be reformed? If the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſleep, and the Wolf be very vigilant, what ſhall become of the poor defenſleſs Flock?<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98258:198"/>If the Father of a Family be remiſs, What ſhall become of the Son that is let looſe among the heats of Youth? If the Mother ſleep care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and be ſilent, what will the Daughter do having the liberty of Courtſhip? If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſleep in Security, what will not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by the ſeditious and tumultuous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Doſt thou ſee how this ſleep, which we call Omiſſion, is Sloth, is Death, is Miſery, and Confuſion?</p>
                  <p>It may well be defended, that all the ruin of Mankind ſprung from the negligence and ſloth of our firſt Father <hi>Adam;</hi> becauſe he was not diligent and careful to make his Wife keep at a diſtance from the forbidden Fruit, and from having converſed with the Serpent. Is it not certain, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had pulled <hi>Eve</hi> by the Arm, when ſhe drew near to the Tree of Knowledge, and had carried her to walk in ſome other part of the Garden far from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and death, that the ruin of us all might have been prevented? <hi>Adam</hi> ſays nothing; <hi>Eve</hi> holds Diſcourſe with the Serpent. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that from thence would ariſe the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that deadly Apple, from whence we inherit an immortal Mortality.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou ſee the Fault of <hi>Pilate?</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned our Saviour to the Death of the Croſs, and which is more, at the ſame time declared him Juſt and Innocent. All which in my judgment proceeded from Sloth and Omiſſion. It was manifeſtly ſo; for when the Jews brought him as guilty to be examined, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<pb n="369" facs="tcp:98258:198"/>he might have done Juſtice with diligence, truth, courage, and rectitude, he through Sloth and Omiſſion not doing ſo, and through deſire of putting off that buſineſs from his own Tribunal, becauſe it was very troubleſome to him, referred it to <hi>Herod,</hi> to avoid being tired with long Diſcourſes, and wearied with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in which he ſaw there were ſuch ſtrong Accuſers engaged.</p>
                  <p>Why, was it not as eaſie, O <hi>Pilate!</hi> and more juſt, to diſpatch Juſtice and free Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, when thou ſaweſt it in the cruel hands of Malice and Slander, then to remit a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to
<hi>Herod,</hi> who did not deſire it, nor had formed any competition about it? It was more juſt, I confeſs, ſays <hi>Pilate,</hi> but not ſo eaſie; and I embraced that which was eaſieſt, and left Juſtice on the other hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> ſent our Saviour back again to
<hi>Pilate,</hi> and he begins again to be vexed at ſo entangled a Cauſe; for on the one ſide, he knew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of Chriſt, and on the other, he ſaw the Power of his Slanderers. To free our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and chaſtiſe the Jews, Fortitude and Diligence were neceſſary; but to condemn him there needed nothing but Injuſtice and Cruelty. <hi>Pilate</hi> had no deſire to make uſe of theſe, but being too remiſs a Judge, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage to uſe the other.</p>
                  <p>Well then, what remedy? What is to be done in this Caſe? ſays the perverſe. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Let us Scourge Jeſus, let us Crown him with Thorns, and then ſhew theſe ungrateful<pb n="370" facs="tcp:98258:199"/>People their King, whip'd, ſpit upon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd; for how powerful ſoever their Fury be, it is not poſſible but that Compaſſion will ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and overcome it. But, <hi>Pilate,</hi> was it not eaſier and more juſt to condemn, and ſcourge, and crown the guilty Scribes and Phariſees with Thorns, than to uſe an holy and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon in that pittileſs manner? More juſt, 'tis true, (replys that partial Judge) but not more eaſie; for they are many, and he is but one. The correcting of them could not be effected without difficulty, but to chaſtiſe the Innocent, is very eaſie. I forſake Juſtice to follow that which is ſafe and eaſie, and ſo let Innocence pay for the fault of my Sloth and Remiſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And how ſucceeded the Omiſſion of ſo faint-hearted a Judge, with this cruel Expedient of ſaving our Saviour by ſcourging and crowning him with Thorns? Much worſe, than if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pity or remorſe he had given him out to be crucified. For the People being hard and obſtinate, were not ſoftned with the Pains of the Holy Jeſus, but rather they became more obdurate in their ſin, ſeeing that their Paſſion and Wickedneſs was more couragious than the heart of the Judge; and therefore not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get the Victory over him, they cried out more fiercely with loud Voices, <hi>Let him be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, Let him be crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Judge, being of himſelf cowardly and fearful, was the more afraid, hearing ſuch furious Cries, and finding that the matter grew
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98258:199"/>harder upon him, was conquered by them; and being ſlothful, timorous, and unactive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to condemn him, becauſe he had not the courage, diligence, and induſtry which were neceſſary to ſave him.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Pilate,</hi> if thou meanedſt to condemn him after he was ſcourged, buffeted, and crowned with Thorns, and after thou hadſt ſhewn him to the People as a Mock-King, affronted and abuſed; had it not been a leſs Evil to have condemned him before, and to have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe Pains and Reproaches? It would have been a leſs Evil, (ſays he) I confeſs; but my faint-hearted lukewarmneſs uſed them as means to ſave his I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nocence; and the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a ſlothful perſon tend always to his own conveniency, and the injury of another.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve what a kind of pity that of the ſlothful man is? and thou wilt find it more cruel then Cruelty it ſelf. If <hi>Pilate</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned our Saviour at once, how unjuſt, how ſevere, how cruel ſoever, yet he had ſpar'd him five thouſand Laſhes, and an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Reproaches; whereas by being pardoned and defended with ſuch ſloth, his Pains and ſufferings were infinitely aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Beſides, the lightneſs wherewith this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Judge paſs'd over ſuch terrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, was in a manner worſe then all the reſt; for with but waſhing his Hands in a little Water, the Preſident declar'd himſelf, and all the People Innocent, and the Innocent Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He declared the Innocent Guilty, becauſe<pb n="372" facs="tcp:98258:200"/>though he knew and confeſſed his Innocence, yet he ſuffered him to be Crucified as a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; and he Abſolved the guilty People, becauſe he forbore to Chaſtiſe them, though he knew their Malice.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this is, that amongſt all the other great Evils, of the Sloth, Omiſſion, and Negligence of Judges, this is one, that it is very ſhort-ſighted, and forgetful of all the Miſchiefs that it does; for it looks with very little, or no light at all, upon thoſe Evils which either it committeth or permitteth. <hi>Pilate</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns our Saviour, and delivers him into the hands of his Enemies; he delivers up that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lamb to thoſe ravenou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Wolves; he gives them a greater liberty than they had before; and not only whips and impriſons him; but condemns him alſo to be Crucified; and with a little Water not only waſhes himſelf from all theſe Wickedneſſes, but commends himſelf, and expects to be thought a juſt, an holy, and an innocent Judge.</p>
                  <p>A City ſhall be enflam'd with heinous Crimes, a Commonwealth ſhall burn in all manner of looſneſs and debauchery, and a lazy ſlothful Governour ſhall in the mean while ſleep careleſly whole nights and days; and although all thoſe Enormous Crimes are committed, becauſe his remiſneſs forbears to correct them; yet becauſe he does not act thoſe things himſelf, he thinks he is holy, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and guiltleſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:98258:200"/>No, do not ſo; do thou ſtrive in thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in thy Employment to act with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, diligence, and vigilance, abhorring Sloth and Remiſneſs. Do not make the ſins of others become thine own Crimes through O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Take not upon thee the Office of a Judg, Magiſtrate, or Superiour, unleſs thou haſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, Diligence, Zeal, and Courage to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Offences. It is not I that tell thee this, but the Word of God in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, If thou art a Governour, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt thoſe that are under thy Charge to commit Wickedneſs, thou makeſt their Faults to become thine own. Meaſure therefore thy ſtrength before thou undertakeſt ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and having entred into it a Judge, take heed thou come not out of it a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p>Sloth and Negligence are, as we have ſeen, hurtful in all Perſons, but in Prelates, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and Superiours, it is the Peſt of the Publick; for under the coldneſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Omiſſion, there is no Miſchief that will not be ventur'd upon, all bold daring Crimes being the Conſequences of it; and it is better to live, where nothing, than where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is counted lawful. But in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, Diligence is that which promotes it, ſecuring our inward Advancement, and our going forward in the way of Vertue; for every ſtep that Diligence takes, adds Glory to the Crown of our Reward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="374" facs="tcp:98258:201"/>The time of our Race paſſeth ſwift away, that of our Life flies very faſt, and which is moſt dangerous, Death haſtens, and then we ſhall neither have time to run, to work, to make ſatisfaction, nor to recover the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities we have loſt; and therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make uſe of this preſent Moment, before it paſs, for it is impoſſible to be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Work, while you have light,</hi> ſays the Saviour of Souls; Work before my Time come, in which I ſhall call you to account, and judge you for your Time. On the other ſide, while you have light, walk and work, before the Day-light of Life paſs away; leaſt having ſpent your time viciouſly or idly, (which is all one) the darkneſs of the Night of Death ſeize upon you at unawares. Can any Evil be greater or equal to that of loitering all the day in idleneſs and vice, expecting the darkneſs of Night, and of Death, the puniſhment of idle, vicious, and ſlothful Perſons? The Life of our Saviour in this World, was all working, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking pains, walking, watching, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, putting Men in mind of the account they were to give, of the Univerſal Judgment, of Hell, and of Glory. His Zeal, his Diligence, and his Goodneſs not ſuffering his Charity to be one moment idle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the day idle?</hi> ſaid he in the Parable to thoſe that were found in the Market-Place; as who ſhould ſay, Can you ſpend all the Day in ſloth and idleneſs, while
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:98258:201"/>Night, the Sword of the ſlothful, hangs over your Head, and will certainly fall upon you? If you will not work in the Day, how will it be poſſible for you to work in the Night? If you refuſe him the Day, which is the time of working rightly, and with profit; 'tis manifeſt that in the Night you will find nothing but Errours and Miſchiefs. Who would refuſe to go his Journey while the Sun ſhines, believing that he ſhall find his way better in the dark? Therefore ſhake off idleneſs, and embrace fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and diligence. Do you think you ſhall be able to find diligence at your Death, when you have waſted all your Life in lazineſs, and in ſloth? or that you ſhall find Amendment when you come to be judged, Idleneſs being the Mother of all Vices?</p>
                  <p>The Saints call Idleneſs the Sepulchre of the Living, becauſe Worms, Rottenneſs, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption are engendred by it, and that it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all kinds of Miſeries together. That holy Man underſtood it well, who living in the Deſart, buſied himſelf in carrying ſtones from one place to another, and in bringing them back thither again; and being asked why he did ſo, he anſwered, <hi>I avoid idleneſs, or at leaſt I maſter that body that would maſter me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Vice is ſo deſtructive to the Spirit, nor ſo kind a Companion to the Fleſh, as idleneſs; and although it ſeems the leaſt, is yet the cauſe of the greateſt Evils. Beſides, being ſlothful and idle in good, there is no ill which does not encreaſe and become worſe by it; for it is<pb n="376" facs="tcp:98258:202"/>the ſame thing as to ſet open the Gate of the Soul to all the Paſſions and Vices that ſhall have a mind to enter. There is no Vice ſo mean, but will adventure to aſſault an idle Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it looks upon him as one that will not take the pains to make any reſiſtance, being ſo weak as to have yielded up himſelf even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be attempted, and ſo all wickedneſſes take confidence to come upon him, and aſſume to themſelves a Juriſdiction over him.</p>
                  <p>If the Devil be diligent, watchful, bold, ſtrong, heedful, crafty, and cruel, What will he be not able to do againſt a weak, idle, careleſs, and diſarmed Man? The holy, the ſpiritual, and the diligent, who night and day buſie themſelves in ſome vertuous Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have much ado to eſcape free from the Aſſaults of the Devil? How then ſhall the ſlothful be able to defend himſelf from ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning and ſo dangerous an Enemy?</p>
                  <p>So much thou doſt encreaſe in holineſs, as thou doſt encreaſe in diligence, and therefore work always without ceaſing; for thoſe works are Safety and Reward, and do advance thee in Spirit and Charity. The bleſſed Virgin came to ſo much Perfection by working; for having begun with ſuch unſpeakable Graces, ſhe roſe to more than can be imagined, only by going on each moment, encreaſing and improving her former Gifts and Graces. The holy Apoſtles were the Light of the World; and obſerve how diligent they were. They went about like the Sun in perpetual motion;<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98258:202"/>and by that means Twelve Men alone were able in a little more than Thirty Years, to enlighten, to reduce, and to confound the blindneſs of the Gentiles throughout the whole World. How could holy Perſons in former Ages become in few Years ſuch Prodigies of Holineſs, but by their diligence to encreaſe and redouble their Talents, and by conſtantly following the Dictates of the Holy Spirit which governed them? Even thoſe valiant and ambitious Men that heretofore conquer'nt ſo many Nations and Countreys, could never have done it, but by diligence: One of thoſe being ask'd, <hi>How in leſs than Nine Years he had gained ſo many Kingdoms;</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinando,</hi> by not delaying till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>If this be neceſſary for the Conqueſt of frail, mortal, and inconſtant Kingdoms, that are but Heaps of Dung; What diligence and care is needful in us Chriſtians, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eternal Kingdom of Heaven? Traffick, till I come, (ſays the Saviour of Souls;) Be induſtrious, and ſuffer not your Talents to lie idle.</p>
                  <p>That ſlothful Servant, who buried his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, did no other harm, but that he did ſo, and ſat down quietly by it; and yet for all that, the Lord condemns him to Hell, and calls him wicked Servant; <hi>Serve nequam,</hi> Curſed of God, becauſe being lazy and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, he gave that to the Earth, and to<pb n="378" facs="tcp:98258:203"/>what is Senſual, which was due to Heaven, and to what is Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>Our Humane Condition and Miſery can hardly hold to an Indifference. If thou doſt not labour in that which is good, thou wilt take pains in that which is Evil; not to watch, is to fall aſleep; not to ſerve God and pleaſe him, is little better than to offend him; and in the Opinion of thoſe who will allow no indifference in things, it is (as I have ſhew'd) abſolutely to offend him.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, 'tis not for nothing that Chriſt ſo often calls upon us to Watch: He pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that word fourteen times, and his bleſſed Lips exhort us to it ſo often, with that very ſame word, Watch. Sloth, Idleneſs, Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Negligence, is the ſleep of Death, which carries us to Death Eternal. Watch then, for the Devil ſleeps not; for thine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite ſleeps not. Watch, leaſt the Bridegroom find thee without Oyl, like the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, when he ſhall come to judge thee. Watch, for the Thief goes about carefully to rob thy Houſe. Watch, for the Infernal Lyon goes about ſeeking to devour thee. Watch, and expect the coming of thy Lord, with thy Lamp burning, when he ſhall come from the firſt Marriage unto the ſecond; that is from his firſt to his ſecond Coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:98258:203"/>Finally, If thou wilt be a true Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, thou muſt work, and labour, ſweat, and walk without ſtopping, and with fervent ſteps follow the Lord, who goes before thee carrying the Croſs on his Divine Shoulders, and giving ſtrength, breath, and courage unto thy Fervency by his Love.</p>

                     <head>Of the Twelve Fruits of the Holy Spirit in General.</head>
                     <p>IT is time now to gather in the Fruits of this Spiritual Year, that we may praiſe God in the advantages of a Plentiful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Light and the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> teacheth us, That the Fruits of the Spirit are Twelve: to wit, Charity, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Benignity, Faith, Continence, Joy, Patience, Goodneſs, Meekneſs, Modeſty, and Chaſtity.</p>
                     <p>I admire that he puts the End in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ſeems to make the Root to be the Fruit: For I ſhould think that the Fruits of the Spirit were the Graces and the Bleſſings we have already treated of in ſome of the former Months; that is to ſay, a happy Death, Abſolution from Judgment, a Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to us at the paſſing of that Sentence, and the Reward, Crown, and Glory of the Bleſſed in the other Life, which is given to<pb n="381" facs="tcp:98258:204"/>thoſe that have fought a good fight in this; but to make the Fruit of the Spirit, and of being vertuous, to be Vertue it ſelf, ſeems to me ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put the end of Vertue in the middle; or elſe to anticipate that Fruit in this Life, which only can be attained perfectly in the Life Eternal.</p>
                     <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> by naming the excellent Fruits of the Spirit, wiſely anſwers the wicked of this World, who hold the Spiritual Life for Folly, and laugh at the Godly, for mortifying and perſecuting themſelves with Abſtinence and other Acts of Repentance, living retir'd and abſtracted from the World, and deſpiſing Humane Delight and Felicity. Looſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Perſons uſe to ask thoſe of ſtricter Life, What Fruit do ye get by that Mortification, by that Solitarineſs and Faſting wherewith ye torment and deſtroy your ſelves? Had you not better live merrily, and enjoy the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, as we do? The Apoſtle replys, What Fruits do we get? Twelve heavenly Fruits the Holy Spirit gives us, which we would not Exchange for all the Fruits, for all the Delights, and for all the Pleaſures which the World can beſtow. And we muſt take notice, that he moſt diſcreetly forbears to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon for the preſent Fruits, thoſe Eight Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes with which Chriſt begins his Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount, for they are Promiſes of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in the future; and though ſome of them are not without effect, even in this Life, yet they all chiefly regard the Life to come. He<pb n="382" facs="tcp:98258:205"/>ſays, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted;</hi> that is, with everlaſting Comforts. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall poſſeſs the earth;</hi> that is, the Land of the Living, which is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, do earneſtly deſire to be good: <hi>for they ſhall be filled;</hi> that is, ſhall have moſt perfect goodneſs in Glory. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy;</hi> that is, at the Day of Judgment. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Bleſſed are the Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, for they ſhall be called the children of God. Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> would not reckon theſe for the Fruits of the Spirit, becauſe our Saviour had ſpoken of them before in his Goſpel; and theſe are not the Fruits of our Baniſhment, but of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Thoſe Beatitudes are the Fruits of theſe other Twelve, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here nameth. That which he meant, was to turn the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thoſe poor deceived Wretches of this World; ſaying, Do ye ask us, What Fruit we have in mortifying our ſelves by the power of the Spirit? We anſwer, That we not only obtain Eternal Glory (as Chriſt promiſed us) in the Life to come, and that proportionable to what we ſuffer here; for he ſays, We <hi>ſhall receive an hundred fold:</hi> but that even in this Life he gives us Fruits of Glory, Comfort, Peace, and Joy; and the Spirit cauſes ſuch heavenly Effects in us, as give our Life the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage far above all the Feaſts and Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<pb n="383" facs="tcp:98258:205"/>of yours. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to compare Spiritual Delights with Senſual Pleaſures; and the Recreations of the Good, with the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Wicked. This appears in that he does not count Eternal Glory for the Fruit of the Spirit; but thoſe Effects which the Spirit it ſelf produces in this Life, which are Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, The Spirit has two ſorts of Fruits; one for this Life, which is an Internal Glory; and the other for the Life to come, which is both an External, Internal, and Supernal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Two Fruits, one of Temporal Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and the other of Eternal Peace in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>This Queſtion, which ſinners make to the righteous, ſeems to correſpond to that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes to ſinners, when he asks them, <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> and they, (if they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer truly) can anſwer nothing, but that Grief, Miſery, and Confuſion has been the Fruit of them: but they anſwer only with another Queſtion, ſaying, And you, What Fruit do you get by following of Vertue? To which St. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, Not One Fruit, but Twelve moſt ſavory and pleaſant ones, which are the cauſe of Eternal Fruits. He likewiſe impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly puts the Beatitudes for the Fruit of the Spirit, and comprehends them in theſe Twelve, as one that gives the name of the Effect to the Cauſe; for it is as if he had ſaid, Do thou aſſure me that thou enjoyeſt theſe<pb n="384" facs="tcp:98258:206"/>Twelve Fruits of the Spirit in this Life, and I will aſſure thee, that thou ſhalt enjoy thoſe Eight Beatitudes in the other Life. Do thou aſſure me that thou liveſt here in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, and I will aſſure thee that thou ſhalt Reign there for ever in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, one would think that theſe Twelve Fruits, which we now ſpeak of gathering in, and ſtoring up for the Harveſt of the Spiritual Year, ſeem to be thoſe common Vertues we ſpoke of in the Second Part; but though they be like, there is great difference between them; for this Peace, this Chaſtity, this Charity, this Benignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not altogether the ſame with thoſe there ſpoken of; but theſe do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe thoſe, and theſe are a Supream Habit which God gives by his Holy Spirit, whereby he raiſes, facilitates, perfects, and crowns thoſe Vertues which are there begun, and brings them to an high, and heroical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Reaſon upon which I ground my ſelf, is, That thoſe Vertues, though they be ſerviceable for the Exerciſe of Grace, yet they are not called the Fruits of the Spirit, but Vertues which conduce to the Spirit, and with which we begin and proceed in the Spiritual Life; but theſe Fruits which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here mentions, are more than Vertues, they are Gifts and Fruits which grow from the Spirit; and as a Tree, after having been digged about, manur'd, prun'd, and taken care of all the Year, does by gathering an inward Sap beget<pb n="385" facs="tcp:98258:206"/>the generative vertue of its Fruit, defends it by its Bark in the Winter, ſhelters it with its Leaves in the Summer, ſeaſons it with the Sun and the Air in the Autumn, and laſtly, offers up its Fruit to be gathered by the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is the beſt of all his Labours: So alſo theſe Twelve Fruits of the Holy Spirit, are the beſt of the Spiritual Life, and much more excellent than thoſe Vertues wherewith Men begin, and go on in it at the firſt, and theſe grow from them into a Fruit, which by and through their means, the Holy Spirit ripens, and makes more fragrant, more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, and more ſubſtantial, than all thoſe Vertues of the beginning.</p>
                     <p>We will go on, diſcourſing of theſe Twelve Fruits in the remaining Weeks of this Spiritual Year, to the end that thou mayeſt rejoyce in finding, That Bleſſedneſs is not only the Reward of Vertue, but that Vertue it ſelf is Bleſſedneſs already; and that thou mayeſt ſee, and know, and feel within thy ſelf, that whatſoever is not Spirit, and Vertue, and the Love of God, is nothing but Sadneſs, Pain, and Miſery.</p>

                     <head>Of Charity, the first Fruit of the Holy Spirit.</head>
                     <p>Here St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Maſter of Souls, ſeems in theſe Fruits, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit to joyn the beginning with the end, and the Root with the Fruit; for he ſays, that the two firſt Fruits which the Holy Ghoſt gives<pb n="386" facs="tcp:98258:207"/>to a Spiritual Man, are Charity and Peace.</p>
                     <p>This Charity, which the Apoſtle here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as the higheſt Gift and Fruit of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit is reduc'd into two kinds: Firſt that which the Soul bears towards God, not only when it begins to be in Grace, (for that may be with many imperfections and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to worldly things) but an excellent, perfect, and inflamed Charity, which with its fire burns up, and with its flame conſumes all the Droſs, Imperfections, and Miſeries which our wretched Nature ſends up as in ſmoke, to the Region of the Spirit. This excellent and ſuperiour Charity, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffers nor allows ſo much as a conſent to the ſmalleſt ſins, nor admits voluntary imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and adhaeſions to earthly things, how little ſoever they be, and which, if they come, does not entertain them, but preſently caſts them out and bewails them, is a great Gift of the Holy Spirit, the higheſt of all its Fruits; for this ſtrips the Soul of all that is imperfect, and cloaths it with all that is holy, perfect, and heroical. This Fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the Source and Original of whatſoever good our weakneſs is capable of; it takes off thoſe Skins that covered the old
<hi>Adam,</hi> and adorns us with the Garment of Grace of the new
<hi>Adam,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Thoſe Skins are our Paſſions and Imperfections; and this Garment is made up of our Saviour's Vertue. This Heroick Charity not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, but defends the new Man in us; it roots
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:98258:207"/>out our old cuſtoms of ſin, pulls up thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of ſenſual delight, and throws out thoſe formerly beloved Vices and Miſeries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it hath been choaked up; ſo that the Lord's Inheritance becomes clean and fitly tilled, to receive the ſpiritual Seed, namely, thoſe Gifts and Graces which God is pleaſed to communicate to Souls. Where God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows the Fruit of this ardent Charity, I count that Soul to be ſafely got into Port, as having by the Grace of our Lord overcome thoſe ſtrong Billows, and broken through thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds, that would have hindred its paſſage; becauſe God affords therewith a conſtancy and firmneſs in holy Exerciſes, a continual deſire and longing to proſecute, and to finiſh its Courſe, and to die in Chriſt, with Chriſt, and for Chriſt; for all things elſe, it neither values them, nor loves them, nor fears them. He that has gotten to receive from God this high degree of Charity, is governed in all things by his Hand, and punctually follows his Directions; for he loves the Name of God, and that Love moves and guides, informs, counſels, and accompanies him from Life to Death. This Love is that which the Church asks of God for her faithful Children, when ſhe ſays, <hi>O Lord, who never faileſt to help and govern them, whom thou doſt bring up in thy ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt fear and love; keep us, we beſeech thee, under the protection of thy good Providence, and make us to have a perpetual fear and love of thy Holy Name, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="388" facs="tcp:98258:208"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> had this Fruit of Charity, when he ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate me from the love of Chriſt?</hi> Who? Neither Tribulation, nor Sword, nor Perſecution, nor Death, no, nor Hell itſelf; which is, as if God having cloathed and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Saint with this Charity, had made him capable to defie all Creatures, and all things contrary to the love of his Creator.</p>
                     <p>This Charity and Fruit of the Holy Ghoſt he had, when he ſaid, <hi>That he deſir'd to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and to be with Christ,</hi> for that his Soul filled and enflamed with Charity (which is the ripe and ſeaſonable Fruit of the Holy Ghoſt) waited to be gathered by the hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that Garden who planted it in him; and had not the Earth for its Centre, which corrupts and rots the Fruits that fall upon it; but Heaven, where he was to be laid up and preſerved for ever.</p>
                     <p>This Charity and Divine Fruit of the Spirit that Saint had, who ſaid, <hi>I live, but not in my ſelf, and I ſo earneſtly long after ſo high a life, that I even die, becauſe I do not die;</hi> as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ, who liveth in me;</hi> his Death was Life, and his Life Death; as he likewiſe ſpoke,
<hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> or from the death of this Body, as holding the life of this Body to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than death, and very death it ſelf to be as life, becauſe it was to be a ſweet paſſage to him to Eternal Life. All the Saints have held the ſame, for God communicates this high Fruit of Charity, either more or leſs to them
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:98258:208"/>all, and all of them have ſuffered this amorous Impatiency, which is that the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> expreſſes, when ſhe ſays, <hi>Encompaſs me with flowers, for I die for love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O ſweet Death! O glorious Life! O health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sickneſs! O Coeleſtial Fire, which kindleſt and enflameſt, which enlighteneſt, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moureſt, burning with delight, and by thy conſolations changing Earth into Heaven! O eternal Jeſus! O ſweet! O glorious! O loving and powerful Lord, grant that I may die of this Wound! Grant I may be enflam'd by this Heavenly Fire. Grant I may ſee by this Light, and be conſumed by this Heat. O that I might be turned into aſhes in the burnings of this amorous Fire! and that I may ceaſe to be in this life, to the end, that I may be with thee eternally in the other! Ah! when a Soul once comes to know and to underſtand this Love, how little does it regard the loves of this World; I mean not only thoſe that are light and vain, but thoſe alſo that are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if they be worldly; for God cleanſes and purifies the Soul in ſuch manner, from all Propriety, (although it be of thoſe Affections which are tolerable, yet imperfect through their exceſs) that he poſſeſſes the Soul totally with his love, and from the moſt inward to the uttermoſt extent of the heart, and from the ſuperiour to the moſt inferiour parts of it, fills it wholly with himſelf; ſo that if ſuch an one loves his Parents, whether Natural or Spiritual, he does it in God, and for God; and<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98258:209"/>if he loves his Brethren, whether thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or thoſe of Grace, he loves them alſo in God, and for God, who orders and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all his Love. This the holy Soul ſays in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when amongſt other Favours her Spouſe had done her, ſhe acknowledges, that he had ordered and governed her Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. As if ſhe had ſaid, though there were Charity in me, yet it was inordinate, for I loved ſome more than I ought to have loved them; others, when I ought not to have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; and others after another manner than I ought to have loved them. I loved more than I ought to have loved, becauſe that Affection, which I gave inordinately unto a Creature, (although a Father) I ſtole from the Creator, who is my true Father. I loved them for that, which I ought not to have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for, that is, for mine own Delight, for mine own Intereſt and Comfort; and though my love was Lawful, yet the end of it was Natural, when it ſhould have been Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural. I loved them after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than I ought to have done; for my love was Senſual, whereas it ſhould have been Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and all this the Spouſe felt very much, even in thoſe loves which were allowable, and complained of it to her Beloved, and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty (as being much pleaſed with it) took into his own hand the love of his Spouſe towards her Neighbours, and towards all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ordered it rightly, making her to ove them all, in that manner, for thoſe ends,<pb n="391" facs="tcp:98258:209"/>and in that degree, which he approv'd. And this, which the Spouſe asked of her Beloved, we ought oftentimes to beg of him; for our ſelf love (if the Lord doth not rectifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it) deſtroys and burns up the Soul with an inordinate fire; and ſo the love of God is the only love, which can be called love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of loving too much, and all other loves whatſoever, are loves of fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and diſquiets to an holy Soul. They are loves intermix'd with fears, whether I do not exceed, whether I do not take from God that which I give to the Creatures, whether I do not tye my Soul too faſt unto them, and entangle it with ſnares in the way of my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, thou love of all the Creatures, how miſerable is this Life! how full of Thorns and Stumbling blocks! how full of Griefs, Hazards, and Dangers! Since I cannot love that which is good and allowed, without the fears of running into that which is evil and prohibited. O God, do thou regulate our love. O thou Eternal Good, grant that we may only love thee, and that in thee alone, we may love thoſe whom thou wouldſt have us to love, and that we may do it, when, and how, and for thoſe ends that thou approveſt. Let none other love but thine, O Lord, enter into my Soul. Drive out of it all other loves but that; and if any other would force an entrance into my heart, let the ſtrength of thy love defend it, and not ſuffer any other<pb n="392" facs="tcp:98258:210"/>love to diſturb my Soul, nor oppoſe thy love within my Soul. Thy love, O dear Lord, is a ſweet love; it is Chearfulneſs and Comfort, Quiet and Contentment; it is Joy and Glory. All love beſides this, and contrary to this, is Perturbation and Diſquiet, Heavineſs and Pain, Sorrow and Affliction.</p>
                     <p>Finally, all the Saints have taſted of this Fruit; and I have only given thee an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the end, thou mayeſt know, that the Holy Spirit and its Fruits are the ſame in the Primitive Church, in theſe times, and will be ſo in thoſe that ſucceed us; for God never waxeth old, neither do his Gifts and Graces decay; and if we miſerable ſinners, neither have, nor feel thoſe Fruits, it is becauſe we hinder them with our Paſſions, and by giving the Rein freely to our Inclinations; for there are many now in the World, who have and enjoy this heroical, orderly, and perfect love to God, and to their Neighbour; but let thou and I, who are weak and frail, endeavour to exerciſe our ſelves in thoſe firſt Vertues, and to cultivate the Tree of our Souls with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Contrition, with Mortification and Tears; but above all, with the Blood of the Lamb, and with hearty Prayers to him, who ſhed it through the exceſs of his love, that he would give us that ſweet and excellent Fruit, that moſt raviſhing and glorious Love.</p>

                  <p>Fear and Hope are two Humane Affections, which do diſquiet and diſcompoſe Worldly Minds; God drives out theſe two from a holy Soul, with two Coeleſtial Gifts, which are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt their Poyſon, and theſe be the Fear of God, and the Hope of Glory. From the inſtant that our Soul fears God alone, it deſpiſes all things elſe; from the inſtant that it hopes only for things Eternal, it tramples upon thoſe that are Temporal. Such a Man keeps Peace with all Perſons, becauſe he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubles, nor importunes; he neither vexes, nor is jealous of any body; ſince no body can deprive him of Eternity, which is all he pretends to. This Fruit of Peace alſo hath two parts; one inward, Peace of the Soul with God; the other outward, Peace with<pb n="394" facs="tcp:98258:211"/>the Creatures. From the inward Peace with God, which is the Root, ſprings up the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one, and ſpreads into ſeveral branches of the Creatures, juſt as an outward heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſecret fire, and the brightneſs of light from flame, and the love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from that of God.</p>
                  <p>The inward Peace of the Soul depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Unity and Conformity of a Spiritual Man's Will, with the Will of God; for if he loves and deſires the ſame thing, and conforms himſelf to all that God does, and reſigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all that he ſuffers; and does ſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after things have come to paſs, but even prevents them with his deſire that the Will of God ſhould be done in him; it is manifeſt, that by ſuch an Unity and Conformity, he muſt have a conſtant Peace; and that there can be no diſagreement between that and him. This Union with the Divine Will, and the finding no contraction between it and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Will, begets Love and Peace with our Neighbours, and makes it communicate with all Creatures; for ſince it neither loves them, nor deſires any thing from them, in any other way, than according to God's Will; and that God's Will is in order to Peace, becauſe it is the Original of Peace; it neceſſarily follows, that he muſt alſo have Peace with all the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the true Spiritual Man, who loves God with that Holy Fruit of Charity we have ſpoken of, loving his Neighbours alſo in their
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:98258:211"/>proportion, and keeping Union with the Will of God, and inward Peace with him; and for his ſake with his Neighbours in all things that are good and holy, muſt needs ſatisfie and content all Perſons, if they be good; and if they be not ſo, though he does not content them, (becauſe that is not in his power) yet he ſatisfies them with his Reaſon, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will not acknowledge themſelves to be ſatisfied; for if they be his Superiours, he obeys them with Humility, behaves himſelf towards them with Reſpect, and yields readily to their Orders and Commands; obeying his Superiours in the ſame manner as he obeys the Will of God. If they be his Equals, he gives them all that belongs to them, and applies himſelf with Charity to aſſiſt in their Affairs. He eaſes them in their Troubles, comforts them in their Afflictions, counſels them in their Doubts, and helps them in their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: And if they be his Inferiours, he loves them with a Fatherly Affection, bears with them and favours them, guides and directs them, ſupplies their Wants, and affords them a Remedy ſo far as he is able in whatſoever they have need, for he loves himſelf for their ſake.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Holy Spirit ſays, <hi>Great is the Peace of thoſe that love God;</hi> becauſe they have both outward and inward Peace, with him, with themſelves, and with all Men; ſince they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their love, nor do, nor deſire, nor pretend to any thing, but what God wills.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:98258:212"/>I like all this very well, you'll ſay, but how will you give me Peace with the Wicked? How can a Judge have Peace with Robbers and Murtherers? A Superiour with an Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Rebellious Subject? An Honeſt and Loyal Subject with a Cruel and Mercileſs Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour? Or any one Man with another, that perſecutes him without Reaſon? Is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that a Man's Will muſt not be moved with theſe things, and that neither his inward nor outward Peace muſt be diſturbed by them?</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of difference, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, between holding Peace with the Wicked, and Conformity with the Wicked. This ought never to be done, the other may be done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Conformity ſpeaks Union of Wills in reſpect of their Objects, and this a good Man cannot have but with thoſe that are good, and in thoſe things that are good; for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called Peace, that is War againſt God. If I to keep Peace with the World, ſhould forſake that which is good, and offend God, the Author of Peace, who is the chiefeſt Good, that were but an evil Peace, a ſeeming Quiet, but a real Diſquiet. This is that the Prophet ſpake of, <hi>That they ſhould ſay, Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace; For there is no Peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> And thus when the Saviour of Souls left Peace, as a Legacy, to his Holy Apoſtles, he told them, that the Peace he gave them, was his, not that of the World, nor as the World gives it; for that is a Peace with Vices, with Paſſions, and Senſualities;<pb n="397" facs="tcp:98258:212"/>but a cruel and furious War againſt God. With ſuch Perſons, nor with their Sins, we muſt have no Conformity; which is that the World would have, to make us all of her colour; but we may have perfect Peace, and which is more, perfect hatred at the ſame time, not abhorring thoſe which are evil, but that evil which is in them, and loving their Perſons, that we may draw them into the way of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A Superiour, who is a good Man, may Correct and Reform, and Love thoſe whom he does Correct; nay, rather he does Correct and Reform them, becauſe he loves them with a very perfect and ſuperiour love. Well may a Companion Love and Counſel, Adviſe and Guide his Companion to that which is good, and have a diſlike of the evil which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; nay, becauſe he loves him, he guides and draws him from that which is evil. Well may a Subject diſapprove the ſin of a vicious Superiour, and love him without helping him to effect it; nay, becauſe he loves him, he will not give more matter to his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor add more Fuel to the Fire of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. What! Doſt thou think, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our good Maſter, did not love thoſe Buyers and Sellers, whom he whipped out of the Temple, when he overturned the Tables of the Money-Changers to baniſh Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of his Father's Houſe? It is certain that he did love them, but he corrected them to amend them, and ſuch a Miſchief needed ſuch a Remedy. He relieved their afflicted<pb n="398" facs="tcp:98258:213"/>Souls, that were kept in Slavery by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and ſet their Reaſon at liberty, which was captivated, and kept a Priſoner by their Paſſion. Reproof and Chaſtiſement are as an Alms to the Soul that is poor in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that is in great Neceſſity for want of Light, Counſel, and Direction. Such an one ſtands in need to be corrected and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with Inſtruction and Reformation, by ſuch means as may conduce moſt to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. Who ſays that a Phyſician hates his Patient, when he Cures him with a bitter Potion? He hates the evil Humours in his Body, and deſtroys and drives them out with that bitterneſs. Nor is the Chirurgeon leſs kind when he cuts and lances, than when he binds up a Wound with an healing Plaiſter; And therefore ſick and wounded Men do both thank and pay them for that ſharpneſs and bitterneſs, whereby they recover the ſweetneſs of their Health. And inward Peace with God, and outward Peace with our Neighbour, may be preſerved by us, and yet we not have any Conformity with them in their evil; for ſince Peace is inſeparable from Love, it follows neceſſarily, that from the time we begin to love them, we muſt have an honeſt, good, and holy Peace with them, which is the true Peace indeed, for the other is not Peace, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and a cruel War againſt God.</p>
                  <p>This difference there is between the Will of God and that of Men; that to the Will of God we muſt Conform without any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:98258:213"/>or exception whatſoever. Let him command, order, and diſpoſe whatſoever he pleaſes, for with him there are no Conditions nor Capitulations to be made; We are totally to perform, and abſolutely to deſire whatſoever God wills; but with the Creatures it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for ſince their Rule is not Infallibly good and holy, as that of God, but very weak and fallible, we muſt not deliver up our ſelves to that, nor to their Will, without Conditions; and the firſt of them is, that we never ſwerve, nor vary from that Superiour Will, and that our Prince, our Father, or our Friend muſt never require any thing from us, but that which is agreeable to the Will of God. And if they, or any of our Neighbours go beyond that, we muſt give them Peace, but not Conformity; we will give them Love, to the end that they may love God, and that we may draw them towards God, and bring them to God; but we will not give them Conformity, for then we ſhould offend him, as they do.</p>
                  <p>This orderly, perfect, and holy kind of Peace is a very high fruit of the Holy Ghoſt; for in it infinite good things are contained. And as the Ancient Philoſophers and Poets held, that upon the top of Mount
<hi>Olympus</hi> there was a perpetual Calmneſs and Serenity; ſo the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom God gives both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace, is above all Humane Perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and feels not any Troubles to diſquiet and moleſt him, for he humbles and reſigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freely to the Will of God in all things. If
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:98258:214"/>evil Men perſecute him, he bears it patiently, and reduces them, if they can be reduced; but if not, he turns himſelf towards his God, and begs of him to reduce them, and to bring them home to himſelf; and there is nothing high nor low, great nor ſmall, that can take away that Peace and Tranquillity of Mind, which God gives him, by the means of his Love; for in that love there is a full reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that God doth, diſpoſeth, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth; and there he quiets, comforts, and chears up himſelf, where the Will of God is; for in that the true Peace conſiſts.</p>

                  <head>The Third WEEK.</head>
                  <head>Of the Third and Fourth Fruits of the Holy Spirit, Longanimity, and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</head>
                  <p>THE Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> propoſes Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity as a Fruit of the Holy Spirit, becauſe it is not only profitable, but neceſſary for the preſervation of Peace and Charity, and is a moſt excellent Vertue of Souls. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity ſignifies a dilating and enlargement of the heart, which gives it a capacity of bearing both inward and outward Troubles;<pb n="401" facs="tcp:98258:214"/>and having this, nothing affrights or amazes, nothing terrifies nor afflicts it. And if God did not give this admirable Fruit and Gift to the Soul, it would be loſt, and fall away at every ſtep, and neither act with valour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, nor perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>The heart of Man is ſo little, that it is not ſufficient to give a ſmall break-faſt to a Kite, and ſo of it ſelf it is not capable of any great thing, being ſo wretched a Morſel. Can the Sea be contained in a Thimble? Can the thing contained be greater than what contains it? If the Veſſel of this Human Nature, that is, Man's heart be ſo narrow; what great thing can find room within it? Now ſee the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that God works with the Spiritual Man; and how high a Fruit this Longanimity and the Enlarging of the Heart is, which God gives to a Soul, according to the meaſure it hath ſerved, loved, and pleaſed him; or according as he thinks fit to give it of his own good will, making it ſo capacious, as to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Soveraign Gifts and Vertues of God, and which is more, even God himſelf, who contains all things.</p>
                  <p>It would be a rare thing, if a Man that lives in a poor little Cottage, ſhould of a ſudden find himſelf in a Royal, Stately, and Majeſtick Palace, or in a huge populous City. What a wonderful Enlargement would that be of his poor Hermitage? O Divine Beauty! O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Architect! O immenſe good of Souls! How vaſtly thou dilateſt! how ſtrangely thou
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:98258:215"/>enlargeſt Man's heart with thy Grace, and with thy Spirit! Who does not ſometimes ſee a Man great in Wit, in Fortune, and in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Who in a few years (nay perhaps in a few Months) before was buſily running after childiſh Pleaſures, and drag'd along by his mean, vile, and ſenſual Appetite, in ſuch trouble, anguiſh, and affliction, that his Soul (hardly ſo big as a Child's Rattle) was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of nothing but empty Vanities, his Heart being ſcarcely ſo big in compariſon, as a Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Corn, miſtaking every action, ſtumbling at every ſtep, every thing afflicting him, every thing tormenting him, and God of a ſudden entring into him, and with Soveraign Light enlarging his Heart, and ſpreading out his Mind by Longanimity; he begins to deſpiſe and to mock at thoſe things which he ſo fondly hunted after before, and pretended to, as things highly conſiderable; but now being made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of greater Matters, turning his back to ſuch mean, vile Trifles, he ſeeks after that which is really great and high, that which is heavenly and unſpeakable, without ever reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or contenting himſelf, till he have attained it. What is this? who enlarged that Heart? Who ſtretched out that narrow Veſſel, which before was fill'd with a few ſmall drops, and now nothing can fill it but the unmeaſurable Sea of the Paſſion of our Lord? Who made a Giant of this Dwarf, that before could hardly wield a Straw, and now like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> is able to throw down and carry away Pillars,<pb n="403" facs="tcp:98258:215"/>and bear all the ſtrong weakneſſes of this Life? Who hath made him, that before cried as a Child, becauſe he could not get an Hobby-horſe (for ſuch are the higheſt things the World can give) now undervalue and deſpiſe whole Nature, to ingulf himſelf in the vaſt Ocean of Grace? Who hath made him, that a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followed, hunted after, and embraced Dung and Corruption, to think the whole Heavens too little for him, aiming to ſeek and poſſeſs the Creator of them, and of himſelf? Yeſterday he was as buſie in making little Houſes of Sticks upon the Sand, and covering them with Straw, as Children are about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Dirt-Pies in ſome Corner; and now he tramples upon the Stars, and pretending to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, can content himſelf with no Houſe but the Empyreal Heavens. Who could work theſe Miracles but the Holy Ghoſt, giving that Heart his Fruit and Bleſſing, in that high Gift of Longanimity, which enlarges it, and dilates the Soul, making it capable of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good things; that Supream Gift being the Tree which bears theſe admirable Fruits? This St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, when he ſaid, <hi>When I was a Child, I ſpoke as a Child, I thought as a Child, and did as a Child;</hi> (and in all that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his own littleneſs) <hi>but now that I am a Man, I act as a Man, and put away all childliſh things.</hi> Behold the difference between a Child and a Man: In a Child all things are childiſh; in a Man they are ſerious. In a Child there is neither ſtrength nor capacity; he is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<pb n="404" facs="tcp:98258:216"/>Neceſſity, that lives upon Alms, which Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beſtows upon him, whether it be of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or of his Nurſe, or of any other, that takes pity on him. A Man has ſtrength and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he is a publick Succour, that is capable of any thing. Now the ſame difference that there is between a Man and a Child, (nay a far greater) there is between a good Spiritual Man, and a wicked debauch'd Fellow, that lives in a looſe and ſinful Courſe, I ſay a much greater; for the growth of a Child that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Man, is a natural Growth, which is ſhort, limited, and ſlow, increaſing by very inſenſible degrees, and that hardly riſes ſix Feet from the Ground in fourſcore Years; but the growth of a Man that was wicked, and to whom God hath ſhewed the kindneſs to make him good and holy, and to give him that Gift of Longanimity, that is, a growth of Grace, in which there is no Geometrical material Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Degrees, but is all Supernatural. Behold the diſtance there is between Heaven and Earth, that between an evil and good Man is yet greater. Nay, how far it is from Hell, which is much lower than the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Earth, unto the Empyreal Heaven, where God himſelf doth inhabit; and ſo great is the diſtance between a vicious and a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon. Now conſider what difference there is between a heart, when God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it with this Gift of Longanimity, and what it was before; for that, which was ſo fill'd with ſome trifling Paſſion, that the Breaſt<pb n="405" facs="tcp:98258:216"/>was not able to contain it, but it broke forth and ran over through the Lips, is made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive even God himſelf, ſo vaſt is the difference between an evil and a good Man. And take notice that this place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may alſo be underſtood, not only of the infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Heart of a Man, when it is limited and ſtraitned in the Miſeries of this World, and when it is poſſeſs'd of God, and made capable of his Gifts and Mercies; but alſo between the Heart, that went on in a courſe remiſly vertuous, and that had but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to take ſome ſteps in the Spiritual Life; and an Heart, that by holy Exerciſes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Prayer, hath obtained of God to be enlarged by this Gift of Longanimity; for though it was hard for St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, after the inſtant of his Converſion, to have his Heart taken up with ſlight or trifling things, becauſe God from the very beginning of his Converſion, made that Veſſel of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo capable, as to receive his rareſt Gifts and Graces, for he had rare Light, rare Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and rare Zeal, for the Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, even from the very firſt; yet other Spiritual Men go on following the ſteps of the Spirit in that proportion which the Lord has been pleaſed to communicate to them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of their Service; but in the beginning they were Children, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, and God afterwards by degrees makes them to grow up Men, to become great, and ſtrong, and bold, to own and to perſiſt in a vertuous<pb n="406" facs="tcp:98258:217"/>Courſe; and God gives them ſuch largeneſs of heart at length, that thoſe who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were ſcarce able to ſuch a little Milk, can now digeſt the ſtrongeſt Meat; and thoſe who at firſt were diſquieted with every thing, and whoſe weak Stomachs turned at the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of a Pea, are now able, like Eſtriches, to digeſt Iron. They can bear, and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo to do; they can ſuffer cheerfully, and guide others in the ſame way, without any trouble. And it is certain, that this high Gift and Fruit of Longanimity, though it be very important for all, yet it is moſt ſo for Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, for in them it is neceſſary, that they may know how to bear with patience the Faults and Impertinencies of thoſe under their Charge, and to govern them with patience, and without paſſion. And ſo when God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Solomon</hi> with what he needed for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch an innumerable multitude of Subjects, he, amongſt thoſe other Vertues and Gifts wherewith he adorned him, beſtowed on him alſo, as the Text ſaith, this Longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Largeneſs of Heart, ſo that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd even the Sands upon the Sea-ſhore; as who ſhould ſay, that Royal Breaſt was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all things; nothing could overwhelm or trouble him, for he diſpatched all Affairs with calmneſs and ſerenity.</p>
                  <p>A Spiritual Man ſometimes diſquiets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf becauſe there are ſins in the World. What? Would he that there ſhould be none? If there were ſins in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where Chriſt himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:98258:217"/>who was able to remedy them, Shall there be none where he dwells? Let him remedy thoſe he can, and let him beg of God with Tears and Prayers, that he would remedy the reſt, but let him lay aſide all ſollicitude and diſquiet, and poſſeſs his own Soul with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A Spiritual Man is troubled that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mend a thouſand little Faults in himſelf. What? Would he ſhine here in Perfection? Let him humble himſelf and acknowledge his Miſery, and pray to God for the remedy. Let him bewail his Defects with humility, for God ſees his ſorrow and pain, and knows what he has need of; and if he delay his Amendment to day, probably he will grant it to morrow. In this reſpect largeneſs of heart is needful for all things, and thou muſt underſtand, that God is not a God of Affliction and Diſquiet, but of Peace and Tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Holy Spirit of Longanimity, St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons that of Benignity, which is an outward pleaſingneſs, proceeding from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one, whereby a Man behaves himſelf with Charity towards all; and it was diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of the Apoſtle to place this after Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity, becauſe it is a ſweet Effect of that moſt generous Vertue, and as it were a Fruit, or benefit of that Fruit. For Benignity, which is that outward gentleneſs of Behaviour, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd not only with the good, but oftentimes alſo with the evil and the wicked, to mend and reclaim them, and to bring them into a better way; and which could not be done
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:98258:218"/>by Benignity without Longanimity; for if I ſhould converſe ſo much with thoſe that do ill, as to diſturb my ſelf, and abhor and diſdain them; if I ſhould be weary of them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, how could I behave my ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with Benignity? How could I by Charity draw them to Grace and to Charity? and how could I win them with ſweetneſs, and bring them gently to that which is right? <hi>Gracious and righteous is the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>David.</hi> Firſt he calls him gracious, then righteous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his graciouſneſs and benignity, he brings ſinners into the right way, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the ſame Verſe of that <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And in another, <hi>O taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is.</hi> Taſte of that which is gracious and ſweet, to the end that Nature afterwards may be able to ſuffer thoſe bitter Remedies which Grace applies, for the curing and rectifying of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity then is an heavenly and gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and an Effect of Longanimity and Charity; or I may call it Charity, practiſed both towards the good and towards the bad. Benignity is like the Sun, which does good to all without difference, it covers, warms, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, cheriſhes, guides, and directs all, whether they be good or bad. This heavenly Gift is, as we have ſaid, one of the moſt important Vertues of the Spiritual Life, but chiefly for Superiours, and therefore they will do well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to pray for it, becauſe it tempers and moderates that Zeal, which elſe commonly burns with too much violence in their Charity.<pb n="409" facs="tcp:98258:218"/>To make Iron cut well, they uſe to temper it with Steel, which is ſofter, and makes it cut more ſmoothly than it would do, with its own hardneſs and brittleneſs. The Winter does not leap of a ſudden into the Summer, nor the Summer into the Winter; but the cold of the Winter is ſweetned by the benignity of the Spring, and the heat of Summer is qualified by the temperate Weather of the Autumn. For a good Man to think that he can make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil one good and holy in an inſtant, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that force by force, is neither very eaſie nor convenient. Even God himſelf works na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and makes uſe of theſe natural means to bring Souls to his interiour and ſpiritual Secrets. That Divine Lord ordinarily catches and gain Souls by their Bodies; and ſo in <hi>Judea</hi> and
<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> he cured and rejoyced them with Corporal Health, and then beſtowed Spiritual Health upon them alſo. To his holy Diſciples firſt he promiſed Kingdoms, and Glories, and Crowns, and Thrones of Eternity, to the end that afterwards they might be the better enabled to bear Croſſes and Perſecutions, Deaths and Torments. Firſt they ſaw him Glorious and Triumphant in Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> to the end that afterward they might be able to endure the Pains and Sorrows of Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> murmured, becauſe the Diſciples eat a few Ears of Corn, (a goodly cauſe of murmuring) and the Lord anſwered,
<hi>They now have the Bridegroom with them,</hi> and ſo it is fit there ſhould be ſome little allowance and<pb n="410" facs="tcp:98258:219"/>permiſſion in his Preſence; <hi>but the time will come, when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days;</hi> and ſo it is needful ſometimes to bear, and to ſhew Long-ſuffering, to the end, that afterward by this outward Benignity and gentleneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, we may paſs on to fervency of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to the unſpeakable effects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of the Spirit. Though Chriſt did aboliſh the Rites and Ceremonies of the Old Law; though he buried it, and ſealed it up, and covered it with the Law of Grace; yet he would have it buried with Honour, and that it ſhould be practiſed upon ſome Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even after it was aboliſhed; as may be ſeen in the Holy Scripture, and Divines ſay, it was to make it honourable Obſequies of Graciouſneſs and Benignity; for that was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, which God prohibited afterwards; and ſo do thou endeavour to converſe with Benignity, in all things, and with all perſons, whether they be good or bad. Do thou to all, whatſoever thou wouldeſt have them to do to thee; and believe, that Benignity is a moſt powerful and effectual Inſtrument of Grace, and of Charity.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> counſels his Biſhops, that in their firſt ſix Months, they ſhould ſhew all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Benignity, Courteſie, and Reſpect, with Decency; for the Will being once gained by Gentleneſs, the People of their Dioceſs will afterwards eaſily lend an Ear to their Doctrine. The greateſt Juriſdiction is that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,<pb n="411" facs="tcp:98258:219"/>much more powerful and effectual, than that of the Hand; for that begets Fear, and ſometimes Hatred; and Hatred one while begets Contumacy, and another while De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. But on the contrary, a meek and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Countenance begets Love, and that makes the Will of Man more plyable, and to do any thing better and ſooner. I might ſay, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity is that, which ſeaſons all Humane Actions, and is as Leaven, which gives ſavour to our Bread, or as Sugar, which gives ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our Food. It is as a Coeleſtial Bath, which ſoftens and ſupplies, and gives a nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of motion; and a Superiour oftentimes obtains more with a kind Look, than with an angry Threat. This the holy King <hi>David</hi> begged of God, when he ſaid, <hi>Let the beams of thy countenance ſhine upon me, and teach me thy ſtatutes.</hi> Make me glad with thy gracious Favour, O God, and then command whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou wilt; for a gentle Superiour finds no reſiſtance in his Subjects. With this kind of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it was, that Chriſt looked upon St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when he brought him back into the right way; and by one kind glance of his Eye, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to that ſorrow, which neither the ſo-often-crowings of the Cock, nor the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of them, and of his Fall, could effect. That gracious look drew Rivers of Tears from his Eyes, and he wept with the remembrance of that Gracious Love and Benignity, which thoſe Divine Eyes had caſt upon him. Therefore pray to God for Benignity, and make uſe of<pb n="412" facs="tcp:98258:220"/>it towards all Perſons, for it is the Temper that will make thy Zeal more conſtant, and thy Charity more effectual.</p>

                  <head>Of the Fifth and Sixth Fruits of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, Faith and Continence.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe reckons Faith for one of the Fruits of the Spirit; and that excellent Vertue, being the Root of our Good Works, from which Hope and Charity do grow, and from which all Chriſtian Perfection, and all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good things proceed, as from the Source and Fountain; It is neceſſary to think, what kind of Faith the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; for this does not ſeem to be well fitted, as a Fruit of the Spirit, but rather that the Spirit ſhould be counted as the ſweeteſt Fruit of Faith. That Faith is the Original and Beginning of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and not the Fruit, but the Root of it, is evident; for without Faith there can neither be Hope, nor Charity, nor any other Moral Vertue; nor without Faith can any one be ſaved, nor do any good Action, nor think any good Thought. Look what the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is in reſpect of the means and of the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:98258:220"/>end; that beginning is Faith. Look what the Foundation is in reſpect of the Building; that Foundation is Faith. Look what the thing contained is in reſpect of that which contains it; that which contains it, is Faith. Look what the firſt Number is in reſpect of all thoſe that follow it; that firſt Number is Faith. Look what the Matter is in reſpect of the Form; that Matter is Faith. Finally, look what the Root and Sap is in reſpect of the Fruit and Branches; that Root and Sap is Faith: And ſo we ſee, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledging, that Charity, as the end, is a greater Vertue than Faith; yet he makes Faith the greater, as the beginning; and therefore he ſays, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main theſe three, Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the greateſt of them is Charity. Note, that he places Faith firſt, becauſe without it there can be no Charity; and becauſe that Crowns Faith; for it laſts and continues, even when we come to our Heavenly Country, whereas Faith and Hope are the Vertues of our Baniſhment, and Hope ceaſes with Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as Faith does by Evidence and Light. Charity is the greater, as the Object, End, and Crown of the other Vertues; and Faith is the greater, as the Beginning and Original of them: Therefore it is neceſſary to determine what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, when he makes Faith a Fruit of the Holy Spirit; it being the Root of all the Fruits of the Spiritual Life, without whoſe beginning there can be no Fruit at all. I ſhould believe with ſome Expoſitors, that he<pb n="414" facs="tcp:98258:221"/>ſpeaks of an high Gift of Faith, of a Supream Magnitude, of an Heroick habit of Faith, which all the Creation obeys, and becomes ſubject to; which is a piece, (to ſpeak on that manner, though with impropriety) which is a piece, I ſay, even of Omnipotency itſelf. Think of that Faith our Saviour ſpake of, when he ſaid, <hi>if we had ſo much of it, as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, we ſhould do very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things.</hi> Think, when he ſaid, <hi>If we had Faith, and ſhould ſay to a Mountain, that it ſhould be plucked up, and thrown into the Sea, it ſhould be ſo.</hi> Now it is this kind of Faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſpeaks of. Think what Faith the Apoſtles had and prayed for, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith;</hi> for that they had, was the Theological Vertue; and that they prayed. for, was this high Gift, which the Apoſtle means in this place.</p>
                     <p>Conſider the Father of that Demoniack, who begging of Chriſt to caſt the Devil out of his Son, was asked by his Divine Goodneſs, <hi>Doſt thou believe that I can do this?</hi> And the poor afflicted Man anſwered, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Although I do believe, yet I fear my Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; and therefore, O Lord, I fain would believe with an higher Faith, and with a more firm Aſſurance. The Faith then which that Man deſir'd over and above that which he had already, is that Fruit which is here ſpoken of by St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> Conſider that Faith, for the want of which our Lord reproached St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when<pb n="415" facs="tcp:98258:221"/>he leaped out of the Ship into the Sea, to go to adore him, and feared, and ſunk, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged help, whereupon the Lord ſtretching out his hand to ſuccour him, ſaid, <hi>Why art thou fearful, O man of little Faith?</hi> That Faith which our Saviour found wanting in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> although he had ſo high a Faith, as to throw himſelf into the Sea, is this Fruit of the Spirit. That Faith which gave him the boldneſs to leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea was great; and that Faith which he had in crying out to the Lord for help, was that Faith, which we call the Theological Vertue; but that, which he wanted yet, and which our Saviour found wanting in him, was this high Gift of Faith. Conſider that Faith, with which the ſame St. <hi>Peter,</hi> being with St. <hi>John</hi> in the Porch of the Temple, which was called <hi>Beautiful,</hi> after the Paſſion of our Lord, ſaid unto the lame Man that begged an Alms of him, <hi>Silver and Gold have I none, but that which I have, I give thee; In the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>riſe up and walk;</hi> and he cured him in ſuch a manner, that it ſeemed, as if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had taken Strength and Faith, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of his Purſe. Now this Soveraign Gift of believing, that God can, and that God will work ſuch a Miracle, and that it will ſucceed according to his Faith, is the Gift which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of. Conſider that Faith of the Centurion, and that of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh</hi> Woman, which the Lord ſo highly commended; that Faith is this Fruit of the Divine Spirit. That Faith, whereby the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel<pb n="416" facs="tcp:98258:222"/>was propagated, which the Lord gave to his Apoſtles, after he had confirmed them in Grace, and which was neceſſary to conquer the Gentile-World; and which in leſs than an hundred years enlightened all the World, ſo that thoſe Trophies of Faith were ſeen and heard, and felt in all places, and the Echo of them reſounded into all Countries; that Faith, which we might explain and ſet forth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Examples, St. <hi>Paul</hi> here calls the Fruit of the Spirit; but after Chriſt had formed and eſtabliſhed his Church, he hath very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom given this kind of Faith, unleſs unto ſome few, that have led a very Spiritual Life, and have often conquered the Fleſh by the Spirit, and have held the Inferiour part of Nature ſo ſubdued by Grace, that God hath been pleaſed to beſtow this high Gift of Grace upon them, for the Service of his Church, in ſome extraordinary occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Some others will have this Faith and Fruit of the Spirit here mentioned, to be an high Gift of believing the Truths of God, and his Promiſes. Behold that which the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin had, in believing the Soveraign Myſtery of the Incarnation of her Son, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humility, wherewith ſhe captivated her own Underſtanding and her Will unto the Power of God: Behold that Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Prophets believed and declared ſuch Heavenly Myſteries, long before they came to paſs: Behold that belief of Faith, which the Lord found wanting in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> at
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:98258:222"/>the Waters of Strife, in the Deſart, for which they were condemned never to enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Behold that Faith, which the Holy Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> wanted in the Holy Prieſt
<hi>Zachariah,</hi> when he declared to him, that the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſhould be born of an Ancient Mother, and ſtruck him dumb, becauſe he believed not: Behold that Faith, which the three Children had in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> when they told the Tyrant, that though he ſhould caſt them into the fiery Furnace, or into the Den of Lions, yet the Lord their God would deliver them; nay, and though he ſhould nor deliver them, yet would not they quit their Faith, nor ceaſe to believe in that ſame God; which was a moſt excellent and diſcreet Anſwer. Now this Fruit proceeded from the Spirit, which governed thoſe Holy Souls, and others, that have been favoured and adorned with this Heroical degree of Faith.</p>
                     <p>There be ſome alſo that ſay, that this Gift or Fruit of the Holy Spirit is the Gift of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to keep Faith and Promiſe to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Though this be holy, profitable, and neceſſary, (for if the due regard of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue fall to the ground, all Peace and Truth in Correſpondency between Man and Man falls with it) yet for all that, I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this Holy Fruit is no other, but that Supernatural Gift firſt mentioned, and that whoſoever has that, ſhall have all the reſt; for they depend upon its Power and<pb n="418" facs="tcp:98258:223"/>Vertue. And therefore do thou act with Diligence and Conſtancy. Pray continually with Fervency, and love thy Redeemer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and tenderly; for to thoſe who do theſe things, God grants this Fruit and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gift of the Spirit.</p>

                     <head>Of Continence.</head>
                     <p>Continence, which is the Sixth Fruit of the Spirit, though it ſeem to be the Antidote of that Vice, which is forbidden in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandment; yet I do not believe, that in this place, it ſignifies the Fruit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts that expreſly for the laſt of the Twelve; and it is not probable, that he would offer us the ſame Fruit twice, for that would be an imperfect repetition, and cannot ſuit with the Wiſdom of that Spirit, which guided his holy Pen; and ſo my Opinion is, that in this place by Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is meant an Univerſal Girdle or Wall, that encompaſſes the honeſt Appetite on every ſide, to the end, that it may not go beyond the due compaſs allowed, nor break forth to any thing prohibited; but that it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, guide, and promote the Fruit of the Holy Spirit. Continence is a Gift, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Vertue, whereby whatſoever is looſe and deſtructive; whatſoever is oppoſite or repugnant to the Divine Spirit, is reſtrained. It is a Bridle to the Appetite, and the Bit that<pb n="419" facs="tcp:98258:223"/>curbs it, and brings it ſo under ſubjection, as to make it go right. It is the Mother of the Spirit, and that which moſt nouriſhes and advances the Vertues thereof, making it to become great and heroical. This Gift of Continence begets Mortification in all things, ſubdues the Fleſh, and makes it yield to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: It alſo begets ſelf-denial, whereby a Spiritual Man rejects his own Will, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers himſelf up to be diſpoſed by the Will of God. It begets that Heroical Humility, whereby he brings down Pride, and flies from his own Excellency, to proſtrate himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Excellency of God.</p>
                     <p>This Girdle of Continence, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, that which the Lord bids us to gird our Loins withall, againſt his coming to Judgment; for being begirt therewith, and having our Lamps burning in our hand, we ſhall be admitted unto that everlaſting Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The Ancient Philoſophers were wont to ſay, as we have told you already, that the greateſt part of Vertue conſiſted in Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; and here St.
<hi>Paul</hi> with a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, calls that kind of Abſtinence, by the name of Continence, becauſe that looks at the interiour defence of the exteriour; but this at an interiour care and attention, ſo to encompaſs that, which is within, that nothing from without may ever be able to overcome it. That encompaſſes one, or ſome ſingle Vertue, this all; That is a Natural Vertue<pb n="420" facs="tcp:98258:224"/>and Heedfulneſs, this a Supernatural and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly one, which in all things looks towards God, and is given by God; and this is that Continence which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, and which thou art to pray to God to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <p>JOY is properly a Fruit of the Holy Spirit in thoſe who follow and advance in the Spiritual Life; for ſince all their Care and Diligence conſiſts in emptying the Soul from its own Will, which is that that begets the Paſſions of it; and that they are a certain Vermin, which ſting, diſquiet, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe, and diſturb it; having once freed itſelf from them, the Heart remains quiet, the Soul clear, and God works in it, as in his own dwelling, fills it with himſelf, and with his Bleſſings. It is manifeſt that God is all Peace, Quiet, Chearfulneſs, and Joy, and this Joy is not only found in very Spiritual Perſons, whom God by continual Exerciſes of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Self-denial, has made capable of thoſe Gifts; but even in beginners alſo, for it is moſt certain that in the firſt ſteps of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, the very being eaſed of the burden
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:98258:225"/>of their ſins, and the ſeeing themſelves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that intolerable load, cauſes in them an unſpeakable Joy and Gladneſs. See how often it comes to paſs, that a Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd by God, with the knowledge of his ſins, finding the grievous Wounds they have made in him by his long continuance in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and wicked Life, upon his making a general Confeſſion of them, and taking a firm Reſolution to forſake them, feels in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an inward Joy and Contentment; as if in taking away the Paſſions and Sins out of his Soul, his Body alſo had been freed from Chains and Impriſonments; And he, that a while before, being preſs'd down under the hard Yoke of his Offences, liv'd in Sorrow, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, Diſquiet, and Anguiſh; preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Confeſſion and Abſolution becomes light, and free, lively and joyful by the aſſurance of Pardon. Now, to the end thou mayeſt ſee and believe the Wonders of God, though this happen to all that lead Religious lives; yet moſt frequently to thoſe, that live the moſt ſtrictly, and uſe the ſharpeſt Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Mortification; for God will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Power, and the effects of his Spirit, and make Humane Nature know, that in ſeeking his Infinite Goodneſs, they ſhall find more Motives and Exerciſes of Joy, than they could have apprehended occaſions of Trouble before in thoſe Severities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="423" facs="tcp:98258:225"/>O the Goodneſs and Power of God! O the Greatneſs of his Mercy! Here methinks he Triumphs over our Nature, and will have the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh to know, and Men (as well the bad as the good, and the holy as well as the profane) to underſtand, that God gives more Joy and Comfort in one day of a vertuous Life, than wicked Perſons feel in many years of their repeated Delights. This is ſo efficacious an Argument to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Man in favour of the Spirit, that all they whoſe Judgments are awakened, muſt not only know and avow it; but that ſome have thereby been mov'd to forſake the World, and to follow that holy Call unto a Devout Retirement; and others by ſeeing the Joy, the Peace, the Comfort, and the Delight, which they have met with in thoſe that have embraced the like Auſterities, have with great Devotion followed their Example, and have gone to ſeek that holy Joy in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manner of Life, which they vainly had endeavoured to give themſelves, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the Pleaſures of this World.</p>
                     <p>What is this, O Chriſtian? What doſt thou forſake, and what doſt thou ſeek after? What? Wilt thou leave the Delights and Jollities of this Life? He Anſwers, No; I leave only the Diſquiets and Vexations of it. What? Doſt thou ſeek after Grief, Sorrow, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? No, ſays he, I neither ſeek, nor find any thing, but Conſolations and Satisfactions. I live here in this Religious courſe, as if I<pb n="424" facs="tcp:98258:226"/>were already in Glory; and while I ſpent my time in the debauched Rambles of the World, though I had outward Pleaſure, I had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hell. And that thou mayeſt practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, what the Joy is of thoſe that ſerve God, (beſides innumerable Examples that might be given of it) I can aſſure thee, that I my ſelf knew a Man, not in a Religious Houſe, but abroad in the World, who having left a very looſe and wicked Life, upon the Light of Truth, that had undeceived him, was ſeiz'd with ſo exceſſive a Joy ſoon after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that not being able to contain himſelf, he would riſe by Three of the Clock in the Morning, and ſometimes much ſooner, to break forth into Divine Praiſes, and give vent to the overflowings of his Delight, by ſinging Pſalms, which he was not able to forbear. What is this, Lord? What is this? Yeſterday a Thief and a Murtherer, that fill'd the Air with the Cries of thoſe that felt his Violence; and to day fills it with ſoft Tunes of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Muſick! Yeſterday a Devil, to day an Angel. Yeſterday groaning under the Chains of Vice, to day rejoycing for the recovery of his Freedom! O the Infinite Goodneſs of God! How wonderfully thou workeſt with the Sons of Men! In ſhort, this inward Joy increaſes in ſuch manner in the Spiritual Life, that if God did not enlarge the hearts of thoſe, to whom he gives it, they would even burſt and dye in the exceſſes of it, and paſs from that Spiritual to Eternal Joys; for being greater<pb n="425" facs="tcp:98258:226"/>than can be entertain'd within the boſom of their Soul, it breaks out, and finds itſelf a paſſage through their Lips, and through their Eyes. There are ſome that cannot contain themſelves in their Prayers, but proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cry out, as one did, <hi>Hold, Lord, It is enough, it is enough.</hi> And it is reported of another, that he even died with ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, and that not ſo much grief for his Sins, as the high delights of his Joy, and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Power of the Divine Love, was the cauſe of his Diſſolution. Ah! If thou didſt but taſte the Joyful Affections, and Glorious Delights of the Love of God; If thou didſt but taſte of that raviſhing Wine, which makes glad the heart, that is filled by the love of him that trod the Wine-preſs alone, thou wouldſt know where the holy and true Joy is to be found, and wouldſt abhor all the Delights and Pleaſures of this World, in compariſon of it. This Joy overcomes all Difficulties, it tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples them down, and flies above them, it burns and conſumes them, and makes the greateſt Labours to become a Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Maſters of the Synagogue called the Apoſtles before them, reproved them, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, threatned them, and commanded them, that they ſhould not Preach, ſending them away not only puniſhed, but reproached, and ſhamefully affronted; but they go out, and preſently Preach again <hi>with exceeding Joy,</hi> (as the Text ſaith) <hi>that they were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for the Lord's ſake.</hi> Take heed, ſay
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:98258:227"/>ſome, to the Apoſtles, it is not two Months ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> crucified your dear Maſter; and if you do not forbear to Preach, they will do the ſame to you. What care we? anſwered they, if the Joy we feel outweighs that fear; nay, that Joy hath already baniſhed it, and made us utterly inſenſible of it, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us againſt the worſt that they can do. This Joy, and this Courage continued in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, many of which ſo readily embraced Martyrdom. A Tyrant commands St.
<hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to give him up the Treaſures of the Church, who replies, he will do it very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. He goes and diſtributes the Treaſure amongſt all the Poor he could find, and brings an Army of Lame and Blind, of weak and diſeaſed Perſons unto that Covetous Praetor, ſaying very chearfully to him, <hi>Here I have brought you the Treaſures of the Church.</hi> Take heed, good Man, the Tyrant will be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on thee. Let him do what he can, I care not; for my Joy in ſerving God is dearer to me than my Life. They lay him upon a Grid-Iron with live Coals under it, which kindle the fire of his Joy and of his Love at the ſame time that the flames do ſcorch his Body; yet he ſmiling and jeſting, ſays to the Tyrant, <hi>Now this ſide is broyl'd enough, it is time to turn the other, and you may eat of it.</hi> Who among ſuch real Torments, among that Fire, Smoak, and Confuſion, could produce that holy Jeſt, that Joy, that chearfulneſs, that pleaſantneſs of Wit and Contentment? God, and none
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:98258:227"/>but God, who was pleaſed to make that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr's Joy to Triumph over all his Sufferings. Who made St. <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle to ſing the Praiſes of the Lord, when he was faſtened upon the very Croſs, but this Joy, this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Fruit of the Spirit? Certainly there is no Chearfulneſs, no Contentment, no Joy, but in God. <hi>Rejoyce, and be glad in the Lord, ye righteous,</hi> ſays <hi>David;</hi> and in another place,
<hi>Great is the joy of thoſe that fear the Lord. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and be exceeding glad,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>when ye ſhall ſuffer for my Names-ſake; for great is your reward in Heaven; and Chriſt himſelf, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Thus that inward Joy drives away and baniſhes all the toils and troubles, and all the Sufferings of the Spiritual Life. This Fruit then of the Spirit, which is called Joy, contains in it both Honour and Profit, and is well worth thy praying for, ſince it facilitates and ſweetens all thy Pains, and will make thee forward and chearful in giving up thy ſelf to undergo any thing for the Lord's ſake; and will thereby make thee to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and be loved by him; <hi>For,</hi> as the Scripture tells us, <hi>God loveth a chearful giver.</hi>

                     <head>Of the Fruit of Patience.</head>
                     <p>The Fruit of Patience is more properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Fruit, than the reſt, becauſe Chriſt lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calls it ſo; where ſpeaking of thoſe that keep the good Seed of his Divine Word, and<pb n="428" facs="tcp:98258:228"/>of his holy Inſpirations in their hearts; and lay them up, and put them in practice, He ſays, <hi>they ſhall bring forth their fruit in Patience;</hi> that is, becauſe a chearful and reſigned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is one of the moſt excellent Fruits of the Holy Spirit, and the moſt profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſerve God with Purity; the moſt profitable, becauſe the Lord ſays, <hi>In Patience ye ſhall poſſeſs your ſouls;</hi> which is the greateſt profit that can be attained, or thought of in this life, as who ſhould ſay, if your Life be Spiritual, full of Tribulations, and a ſharp continual War both within and without; if it be a Conqueſt that conſiſt in dying, not in killing; not in Perſecuting and Oppreſſing others, but ſuffering Perſecutions, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing ones ſelf, certainly Patience is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for that War. And as in thoſe of the World, Men get the Victory by Impatience, by Anger and Fury, by Force, and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; ſo in the Spiritual Warfare, we muſt Conquer by Suffering, and by Humility; for the Combat here is to undergo Pains and Hardſhip; to live and die, with bearing, and with Patience. This Fruit is alſo neceſſary, becauſe by it the reſt are preſerved; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle explains it, where he ſays, <hi>Patience is neceſſary for you, that ye may obtain the Promiſes;</hi> and in another place, <hi>That ye may be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the promiſes of Chriſt;</hi> that is, that ye may obtain the Bleſſings, which are ſet forth in the Eight Beatitudes; and in many other places, where the Lord ſays, <hi>Your name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:98258:228"/>
                        <hi>in the Book of Life; and that there ye ſhall receive an hundred-fold, whatſoever ye ſhall have forſaken here for the love of God.</hi> Patience is neceſſary, becauſe neither Faith, Hope, nor Charity, nor any other of the Moral and Cardinal Vertues, without Patience are of any worth; for in loſing that, they loſe their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and become vain and ineffectual. Finally, if this be a life of Labours and Afflictions, of Slanders and Reproaches, what Vertue can be more profitable, more neceſſary, more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and of more frequent uſe, than Patience? For all the blows, both inward and outward, that are ſtruck at the Mind of Man, muſt be receiv'd upon the Shield of Patience, and he that wants that, can never be able to ſuſtain the Combat; therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Chriſtian with Spiritual Arms, puts upon his left Arm the in-expugnable Shield of Patience, that he may be able to withſtand the fiery Darts of his Enemy,
<hi>Aſſumens ſcutum inexpugnabile Equitatem,</hi> obſerving that in the word <hi>Equitatem,</hi> he not only meant to expreſs ordinary Patience, but an equality of Mind, which is the Excellent and Heroick Patience, and that is the Fruit here ſpoken of; as who ſhould ſay, It muſt be a Patience full of Equality, receiving Croſſes and Afflictions with as great a Chearfulneſs and Contentment, as thou couldſt do their contraries. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays not, that thy Patience ſhould be equal, but even Equality itſelf. Conſider the Joy thou haſt for the Favours of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:98258:229"/>God; thou oughteſt to have the very ſame, when he ſends Tribulations, for they alſo are his Favours. Give not thy Affections more to things that are Delightful, than to thoſe that are Diſguſtful; to Pleaſure, than to Pain; to Comfort, than to Affliction. Thy Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought to be equal in Sufferings, as in Joys; in Rebukes, as in Applauſes; in being pull'd down, as in being advanc'd; and in ſuffering Affronts, as in receiving Honours. And this which ſeems to be a very hard Law, is ſo ſweet an one, that though St. <hi>Paul</hi> contents himſelf here with an Equality, yet ſome Saints, as we ſee in the Examples that have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, paſs on further, and expreſs more Joy in Sufferings, than in Comforts; though theſe come from God, and thoſe from the hands of Men. As we may believe, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs of our Lord took more delight in Redeeming Mankind upon the Croſs, than in the Glories of his Transfiguration upon Mount
<hi>Tabor;</hi> though upon Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> thoſe Favours came from the hands of his Father; and upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> his Sufferings came from the hands of Men. So likewiſe thoſe who ſuffer for God, the Holy Apoſtles, and all thoſe that now follow, or have followed them, rejoyce more in Pains and Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which God ſends them by the hands of Men, than in thoſe Favours and Comforts, which they receive immediately from God himſelf: Therefore our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, at his going to his laſt Supper, when<pb n="431" facs="tcp:98258:229"/>he was beginning to enter upon his Holy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>With a great deſire have I deſir'd to eat this Paſſover with you;</hi> but he ſaid no ſuch thing to them, when he went to the Glories of Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi> In imitation of this, we read of one, that for a favour begged of Chriſt to be crowned with Thorns; another to bear the marks of his Wounds, with a lively feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his dolorous Paſſion: One Devout Soul begs, <hi>Lord, if I may obtain my deſire, grant that I may be deſpiſed for thy ſake;</hi> Another medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on Chriſt crucified,
<hi>Lord, I deſire nothing but thy ſelf, and to be crucified with thee.</hi> This in my Opinion was an high and wiſe Petition, becauſe he asked to ſuffer with Chriſt in this life, as Chriſt in this life had ſuffered for him; and then preſently to have Chriſt himſelf for a Reward in the Life Eternal; for he that begs for Chriſt crucified to be made his, it is clear, he does not beg for a Glorious Chriſt, but wounded, bloody, and in the anguiſh of his Paſſion; and ſo he asked not the Crown of Thorns alone, nor the five Wounds alone, but alſo what he ſuffer'd, in the ſcourgings at the Pillar; Not only the Mockeries, the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings, and the pains of his Paſſion, but the Slanders, Affronts, and Perſecutions, which he ſuffered before it; And not thoſe alone, but whatſoever he ſuffered from his Bleſſed Mother's Womb, and the Manger, till he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd upon the Croſs. This we ought to ask and imitate in this life, and to advance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in Grace and Patience, and thereby thou<pb n="432" facs="tcp:98258:230"/>ſhalt ſee how certain it is, that ſuch Holy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Perſons not only do poſſeſs that equality of Patience, wherewith St. <hi>Paul</hi> Arms his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Man, in receiving Affronts and Croſſes, with as chearful a Countenance, as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World; but that their Delight is greater, and their Patience more chearful in ſuffering, than their Joy is in rejoycing.</p>

                  <head>Of the Ninth and Tenth Fruits of the Holy Spirit, Goodneſs and Meekneſs.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <p>THeſe two Fruits of the Spirit, which God gives to thoſe that are exerciſed in the Spiritual Life, are as the Cauſe and the Effect; for in truth Goodneſs is the Mother of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as ſome Fruits by reaſon of their great fecundity, grow one within another; and as an Ear of Corn produces many Grains, ſo Goodneſs produces Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, and Affability, repeated again and again in all its words and actions. And we muſt take notice that this Goodneſs, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> names here for a Fruit of the Spirit, is not barely that Vertue which is the firſt cauſe of Grace; that is to ſay, a diſpoſition to receive and to hold it, by the Soul's being free from the guilt<pb n="433" facs="tcp:98258:230"/>of any great ſin; for that is a Fruit of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs and Mercy, which gave the Soul light and ſtrength to caſt out ſin, rather than a Fruit of the Spirit. But the Goodneſs here meant is in my Opinion an high Gift of Grace and Favour, which God grants to holy Souls, after they have ſerv'd him long in the Spiritual Life; whereby the Soul is cleanſed and purified, not only from greater ſins, but even from leſſer (nay, even the leaſt) Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and by taking away thoſe Barks, as it were, and inward Rinds of our Nature, lays it bare and naked, from thoſe folds and doublings of imperfect Habits, leaving the Soul in ſo great a purity, truth, and ſincerity, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it perfect Goodneſs. It is as if God ſhould make an Old Man to become a New Man; or as if an old decayed and broken Houſe, ſhould by his Power not only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and ſtrengthened, and made up again in the ſame proportion, grace, and Beauty it had at firſt, but alſo be brought to a greater perfection, and enriched with more coſtly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. And though it ſtill leaves in him the incitement and provocation to ſin; (for that never ceaſes, nor does Grace take it away) yet it is as much weakened and diſabled, as Reaſon was in it before.</p>
                     <p>This Goodneſs and Sincerity the Lord found in holy
<hi>Job,</hi> and to give him an high Praiſe indeed, he ſaid, <hi>He was ſingle and upright.</hi> God by his Grace had taken from him all thoſe folds and doublings, which we have in our<pb n="434" facs="tcp:98258:231"/>Souls, thoſe corners and hollow places, where Malice uſes to dwell. He had caſt out all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections from thence, and had filled it with his Lights and Vertues, making him a Mirrour of his high Perfections. This Goodneſs and Sincerity is that, which Chriſt deſir'd to find in his Diſciples, when they were contending who ſhould be the greateſt, and he Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it, took a Child, and laying his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hands upon the Head of that little Angel, ſaid unto them, <hi>Unleſs ye become as this little Child, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Some Authors ſay, this Child was St.
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and Martyr, who was one of the moſt Holy Diſciples that the Apoſtles had, and from that touch of Chriſt's hand, he became ſo much in love with him, that he took for his Motto, <hi>Amor meus crucifixus est,</hi> For his only Love was Chriſt crucified; and at his Martyrdom, this holy Man defied the Lions that were to tear him in pieces, and ſaid to them, <hi>I am the Wheat of Christ, and I ſhall be ground by your teeth, that I may be worthy to be made the Bread of that Lord.</hi> This Digreſſion I have made to quicken the Faith of Clergy-men, for if Chriſt but by touching him, made him to become ſo holy, how holy ought we to be, who not only touch the Bread of the Lord, but the Bread, which is the Lord, and do ſo often Conſecrate and Receive it. Two things God requir'd of the Apoſtles, in imitation of that Child; firſt, Humility, for ſince they were proudly ſtriving<pb n="435" facs="tcp:98258:231"/>who ſhould have the higheſt place, he could not ſet before them a fitter Example, than that Age, and that Humility. Do ye deſire to be great? Then ye muſt become little, that ye may be great; For he that would be exalted, muſt humble himſelf, and he that humbles himſelf, ſhall be exalted. Behold, I came down from Heaven, and have humbled my ſelf, by taking the form of a Servant, to be deſpiſed upon Earth; and ye poor Earthen Veſſels, are ye lifting up your heads, and your pretentions to the higheſt places in Heaven? The ſecond thing, that he requir'd of them, was, that they ſhould have the ſame Sincerity, Goodneſs, and Purity of Soul, which that Child had. <hi>Unleſs ye become pure and ſimple, as this child, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> This was to move them to that firſt Grace in all its Purity and Perfection, ſince without that no Soul can enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For a Chriſtian muſt be brought back to that firſt Grace and Purity, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Baptiſm, either by keeping his Soul from ſin, even from the lighteſt; or elſe after having ſinned, whether lightly or grievouſly, by waſhing his Soul with Tears of Repentance and Contrition, and cleanſing it from all ſtain and guilt by Faith in the Paſſion of Chriſt, and by partaking of his Body and Blood in the Holy Sacrament; and ſo the Soul is brought into the Purity of that little Child, and made capable of entring into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:98258:232"/>Now the Sincerity, and Charity, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, wherewith the Lord by the force of the Spirit, and by the holy Exerciſes of the Spiritual Life cleanſeth and purifieth a Soul, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Goodneſs, which in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is an inward and ſuperiour degree of pureneſs of Conſcience, ſo ſimple, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it reſembles the Innocence of a Child. This Goodneſs is an abſolute compliance of our Thoughts, Words, and Actions to the Will of God. It is a full reſignation to whatſoever God does; that goes whitherſoever his Divine Majeſty directs; performs whatſoever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and ſeeks, and follows, and loves God in all things. By this kind of Goodneſs a good Man does not ſeem to be in ſearch of that which is good, but to be already in the poſſeſſion of it, and holds it as a thing, which he had found before. This Purity of Loving, Thinking, Speaking, and Doing, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus requir'd alſo in his Diſciples, when he ſaid to them, <hi>Let your words be Yea, Yea; and Nay, Nay;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, let your words ſpeak according to your hearts; and your hearts ſpeak according to my holy Will. Say neither more nor leſs than what ye think, for the Speech ought in all things to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Thoughts; and whatſoever is more, can neither be Goodneſs, nor Sincerity; for Chriſt himſelf ſays, <hi>that it is ſin;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to praiſe a Man very much, we properly ſay, he is a Man that thinks what he ſpeaks, and ſpeaks what he thinks; for the former<pb n="437" facs="tcp:98258:232"/>praiſes his Truth, and the other his Ingenuity and Goodneſs. This intrinſick Goodneſs is that which is in God by his Eſſence, and that for which he is ſo often praiſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaying, <hi>Thou art good, O Lord, teach me to be good by thy goodneſs;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, O uncreated Goodneſs, impart ſome of thy Goodneſs to me; and the Soul begs this ſame Goodneſs with a gentle Sweetneſs and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when ſhe prays, <hi>Let the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, O Lord, ſhine upon us, and teach us thy ſtatutes,</hi> which is a Prayer we ought very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to make to God.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of Meekneſs.</head>
                     <p>This kind of Goodneſs is accompanied with Meekneſs, as Light is with Brightneſs; for that being true, and ſincere, and holy, and having ſo much of God in it, his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty does, as it were, cloath him outwardly with the latter, who inwardly poſſeſſes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; making a ſweet and gentle Meekneſs to ſhine through all his Deportment. And ſo thou mayeſt know a good heart by a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quiet behaviour; for nothing moves or diſturbs it. Nothing diſturbs a good Man, becauſe his Confidence and his Affection are only placed in God; he loves and ſeeks him, and diſregards all things elſe. Nothing affrights him, for his Goodneſs by Love doth caſt out Fear; he deſires nothing that is Temporal, for he ſees whatſoever is ſo, paſſeth away, and<pb n="438" facs="tcp:98258:233"/>comes ſuddenly to an end. Nothing moves him, becauſe he only ſeeks for God, who is unmoveable. Nothing afflicts him, becauſe he reſiſts and conquers all Croſſes with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. He wants nothing, becauſe he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes God, who poſſeſſes all things; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing, becauſe God alone is to him All-ſufficient. Now conſider, what Meekneſs that Soul muſt have, who neither loves, nor deſires, nor pretends to any thing; who is neither troubled, nor affrighted, nor diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at any thing; but in all Occurrences reſts quietly in God.</p>
                     <p>This is a rare Meekneſs indeed; I ſay, rare, becauſe it is admirable; and becauſe I believe few have it in this Mortal Life; ſince we ſee that even the holieſt Men have been angry, and there are Perſons that are very perfect, who Reprove and Chide, who Reform and Puniſh with Anger. Nay, even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, who is called the Meekeſt Man upon Earth, was certainly tranſported with great Anger, when he threw down and brake the Tables of the Law, which God had written with his own finger.</p>
                     <p>God and his Love can do all things; and no body can number, or weigh, or meaſure the Miracles of his Grace. But thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, (as I have told thee) if thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that a Spiritual Meekneſs excludes Zeal for Reformation; ſince the being gentle in Heart, and very couragious in Zeal, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough conſiſt together; and it was a great
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:98258:233"/>cauſe of ſurprize and indignation for
<hi>Moſes</hi> to find that People worſhipping an Idol, that had ſo manifeſtly ſeen the Power of God ſo many ways made known to them in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Deliverance. And Chriſt himſelf, who far excell'd
<hi>Moſes</hi> in Meekneſs, as in all other Vertues, was angry, when he whip'd the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that Verſe of the Pſalm, <hi>The Zeal of thine Houſe hath even eaten me up.</hi> And when he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Maſters of the Law for deſtroying the Law, and ſuffering the People to be looſe and wicked; though he was angry with them, yet he was not the leſs meek in heart, for the gentleneſs and ſerenity of it ſhin'd even through his Zeal; and even then alſo he might have ſaid,
<hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.</hi> He meekly had a ſweetneſs within his Zeal, as the Honey-comb was in the mouth of
<hi>Samſon</hi>'s Lion. He ſhewed his Anger to draw them to his Meekneſs, and ſeeing ſo many Diſcourſes, and ſo many Sermons, and ſo many Miracles had wrought nothing upon them; to ſoften their hardneſs, as we do Iron by Fire, he applied that of his Zeal for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Vices do oppoſe and hinder one another, but the Vertues do aſſiſt and help one another. A Man cannot be Prodigal and Covetous at the ſame time; for if he will give Prodigally, he muſt part with that Money, which his Covetouſneſs would fain keep; and the Slothful Man cannot be Ambitious, for that Vice requires great Diligence, and Pains-taking;<pb n="440" facs="tcp:98258:234"/>but Sloth is Idle, and loves eaſe; and thus it is with other inordinate Paſſions: But the Vertues are helpful to each other, and while ſome of them are put in practiſe, the reſt of them lye peaceably in the Soul. Thus Meekneſs, after having exerciſed Zeal in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, receives that Perſon with a gentle ſweetneſs, whom it had drawn to Vertue with much Rigour and Severity: And ſo let Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs remain in thine heart, with Goodneſs, even when thou haſt occaſion to uſe thy Zeal, that it may be according to Knowledge and Diſcretion; for thou muſt take care to ſhew no more of it than is needful, and that when the Cauſe of God, or what concerns his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, doth require it.</p>

                  <head>Of Modeſty and Chaſtity, the two laſt Fruits of the Holy Spirit.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <p>MOdeſty alſo is an excellent Fruit of the Spirit, and a very ſubſtantial one; for it not only contains that which is good, and beautiful, and gracious, and perfect in the appearance; but it mingles itſelf very eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in all our Actions. Modeſty is not only an outward compoſure of the Countenance,<pb n="441" facs="tcp:98258:234"/>Perſon, and Habit, though that be a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and exemplary Vertue; but it is a perfect manner of performing all we do, and a decent way of doing, whatſoever we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. All our Actions in this Life are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Subſtance and Circumſtances, and theſe change the manner of what we do; for if they be well ordered, it becomes perfect; but if otherwiſe, it is defective. Modeſty then is a good, diſcreet, and prudent way in ordering all the Actions of a Chriſtian, and the Circumſtances of them; and to find out that way, is a moſt excellent Gift, and great Fruit of the Spirit. A Preacher may Preach with a good and graceful faſhion, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delivery; or with one that is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to his hearers; and that very defect may make a very good Preacher to be thought an ill one; ſo that his Voice and Action is not leſs conſiderable, than what he ſays. He may Diſcourſe with, and Reprove one of his Flock with a very good Intention, but his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and his Advices will have no Effect, if they be given in a harſh, imprudent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent manner. In the Spiritual Government, whether Politick or Moral, all depends upon the manner; for that changes the ſubſtance in ſuch ſort, that that becomes Poiſon without it, which with it is a Medicine and an Antidote. What imports it, that the Penitent mortifies, and puniſhes, and perſecutes himſelf, if it be by an outward way of Penance, ſo vain, and ſo affected as to ſhew Hypocriſie? On the<pb n="442" facs="tcp:98258:235"/>contrary, the ſame thing being done in ſecret, and well ordered, may have a very good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as proving the reality of Repentance by that indignation againſt our ſelves, for having offended ſo gracious a Father. God in the Prophecy of
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> reproves their manner of Faſting, as having too much in it of their own Will, and tells them, <hi>He will not accept their Fast, becauſe the way of it wus totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him.</hi> This Fruit of a good Mode in all our Actions, and Modeſty, which is an Effect of that Mode or Manner, is that, which in other places, the Scripture calls the Spirit of Diſcretion; which is to diſcern, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the good way from the bad; and to chooſe and judge between two ways of doing any thing, that which is the better, and more conducing to its end; only here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Diſcretion comprehends the ſubſtance of Actions, as well as the Circumſtances; but Modeſty employs itſelf more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Circumſtances, than about the Actions themſelves. All things have their terms and meaſures, and to go beyond them, is to offend againſt Modeſty, and to loſe the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Mode of doing them. Every Action, and every Reſolution is cloathed and coloured by its Circumſtances. Now to make the Garment long or ſhort, large or ſtrait, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Perſon, and to ſuit or change the Colours, or to mix them together with a good fancy, gives not only the Beauty, but the Convenience and Perfection of the Dreſs.<pb n="443" facs="tcp:98258:235"/>A Man muſt uſe Mildneſs in Reproving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon requires it, who perhaps will be enraged, or driven into deſpair by Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore to make uſe of that, and neglect the other, is to loſe the ſubſtance for the manner, and to fruſtrate his own deſign, by having choſen a wrong way. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if I have to deal with another Nature, that by Gentleneſs grows more negligent, and runs into greater Liberties, but by Rigour may be reſtrained, and kept to the performance of his Duty; then in taking that way, and leaving the other, I ſhall obtain my end, and make the Circumſtance to gain the Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>In great Painters, that which moſt raiſes their Reputation, is their well diſpoſing of their Colours, not only in fitting and mixing them amongſt one another, but in ordering them upon the Picture, and in ſuiting and laying them in proportion to the intent and action of the Subject. Juſt ſo we are to do in Spiritual Affairs, ſtriving (as good Painters) firſt to make an exact Draught of the Deſign, and then to colour, and form, and reform it with ſuch skilful touches, as may bring it to an entire Perfection. How many great, nay, very great Men in Knowledge, and in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and in deſire of doing good, have loſt themſelves by their way of going about it, and have not only loſt themſelves, but even thoſe alſo, to whom they intended that good? Therefore the Director of this Modeſty, or Mode of Acting, muſt be Prudence, which<pb n="444" facs="tcp:98258:236"/>is one of the chiefeſt Vertues of the Spiritual Life: A Vertue ſo high, and of ſuch pre-eminence, that it not only governs itſelf, and Mankind, but alſo all the other Vertues. To govern thoſe that are Vertuous, is a great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Pre-eminence; how great an one therefore muſt it be to govern the Vertues themſelves? And this is that, which Prudence does, which is the Natural Mother of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, or the right Mode of performing any Action.</p>
                     <p>That which I ground my ſelf upon, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this Fruit is not only an outward Modeſty, but an holy Habit, or manner of doing that which is honeſt, decently; that which is good, perfectly; and that which is beſt, diſcreetly; is (beſides that ſome Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors are of that Opinion) the Experience I have had of the Treacheries of an outward Modeſty, and how little that is to be truſted for a Proof of that which is interiour and ſubſtantial. Now a thing, that is in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and without ſubſtance, cannot be a Fruit of the Holy Spirit. It is a good thing to ſeem good, and therefore an outward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty hath ſome degree of Goodneſs; but it is not to be valued unleſs the internal anſwer to the external. An outward behaviour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly governed, while the inward thoughts are looſe and ungoverned, what is it but a well-compoſed Falſhood, and a well ſtudied Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie? And all this is highly abominable to God; nor do I wonder he ſhould abhor it,<pb n="445" facs="tcp:98258:236"/>for his Divine Majeſty is Truth and Sincerity itſelf; and therefore he muſt of neceſſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt a ſubſtantial Lye, mask'd under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Truth. Chriſt reproved the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for making clean the outſide of the Cup and Platter, while within they were full of the deadly Poiſon of Extortion and Exceſs. <hi>Make clean</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the inſide, and thereby the outſide will become clean alſo.</hi> He alſo calls them whited Sepulchres, which had the appearance of Vertue and Religion, but within were full of Bones, Worms, and Rottenneſs; as if he ſhould have ſaid, Ye have lively Paſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while your Paſſions ſeem utterly mortified without. Thus this outward Modeſty, while it correſponds with the inward, is both Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Example; but if it be not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to that, it is but a Mantle of Snow that covers an heap of Dung; the Sun of Truth comes and melts it, and then it is ſo much the worſe, by how much before it appeared the better. Outward Modeſty is always conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, in as much as it covers Imperfections, to the end that a fault may not paſs on to a ſcandal, which is the worſt and the moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing in the World; yet when an ill Man makes uſe of outward Modeſty to give Credit to his Authority, and to thoſe Erroneous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes which he inwardly favours, that conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wickedneſs is a great deal worſe than a manifeſt Crime. A Wolf in Sheep's cloathing is much more dangerous to the Flock, than when he appears in his own ſhape, for ſo he<pb n="446" facs="tcp:98258:237"/>is known both to the Dog, and to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. The one does but whiſtle, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſently flies at him; but when he comes in a fair Diſguiſe, he is unknown to both, and the poor Flock is in danger to become his Prey. Every body that has Eyes, may eſcape a Precipice, but hardly any body can eſcape a Snare; for that has a ſeeming ſhew of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but the other viſibly ſhews the Hazard and the Danger. The Common Enemy is never more dangerous to Souls, than when he tempts with pretences of Good; for he that takes him for an Angel of Light, and of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, will more eaſily ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded, than if he ſaw him in the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Devil. Though the Devil was a Serpent, yet ſome Expoſitors ſay, he ſpoke not to our firſt Parents in the figure of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but cloathed himſelf with a beautiful Appearance, for fear leſt <hi>Eve</hi> ſeeing him ſo ugly, ſhould have been afraid of his approach, and ſo not have ſuffered her ſelf to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him. He took the Colours of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, which was Beautiful in ſhew, and Poiſon in reality.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Subſtantial Fruit of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which thou muſt endeavour to obtain, is not only an outward Modeſty, for under that great Treacheries, and much Hypocriſie may lye hid, though of itſelf it be good, when it is not abuſed; but an outward and an inward Modelty coupled together, as well in the actions, as in the manner of doing them; and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:98258:237"/>in ordering all we do in ſuch a way, that the Circumſtances and Subſtance may receive mutual Advantage from one another, and may together be like a fair gilt Caſe and Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, exactly fitted to the proportion of a well-wrought Clock, whereby being preſerved from Ruſt and Foulneſs, and defended from thoſe Accidents that might ſpoil and diſorder it, the motions of its Wheels are kept regular, and it is not only an Ornament to the place where the Maker ſets it, but a needful Help and Direction to all that look upon it for the diſpoſing of their Time, and of their Affairs; and thereby the worth of the Caſe is alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, as a neceſſary and proper means of attaining the end for which the Clock is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; but if that be taken away, the Caſe remains an empty uſeleſs thing; and though the ſight of it may pleaſe Fools and Ignorant Perſons, who regard not, though the Hand point to a wrong Hour, yet thoſe of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments will ſoon perceive the want of life and motion, and diſregard it as a thing of a flight and inconſiderable value.</p>

                     <head>Of the Fruit of Chaſtity.</head>
                     <p>The Fruit of Chaſtity is alſo a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and higher Vertue, than that we formerly ſpake of; for this Fruit grows out of that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flower of that Tree, and the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Holy Root. This is a Chaſtity of an Heroical degree, a Chaſtity of Supream
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:98258:238"/>Magnitude; 'tis that, which thoſe Saints were bleſſed with, who gave their Lives to defend it, or not to loſe it. This is that, which the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Virgins, and the prime Example of Chaſtity, had. This is that, which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had, not only the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, who was firſt of that Name, when by his Chaſtity he triumphed over the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Lightneſs of his infamous Miſtreſs, chooſing rather to ſuffer a cruel Impriſonment, than to blemiſh it, or do a Treachery to his Maſter; but alſo the other Patriarch
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Bleſſed Virgin, more Holy, and more Chaſt than the former. This is that, which the great <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had in loſing his Life, for having endeavoured to cleanſe the heart of that Tyrant <hi>Herod</hi> from the Vice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chaſtity, which coſt him his Head, that was ſacrificed to the Revengeful Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs. And this is that, which many of the Primitive Chriſtians valued to ſo high a degree, that nothing could ſtain the whiteneſs of their Chaſtity but the Blood of their own Veins, which was ſhed for the preſervation of it.</p>
                     <p>This excellent Vertue may live and reign alſo even in Wedlock, and ſhine brightly in holy Matrimony; for Continence, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Modeſty, in the uſe of Marriage, is perfect Chaſtity; ſanctifying, honouring, and authorizing that holy Bond, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays. This Fruit of the Spirit is acquir'd, or, to ſay better, given by God, through the Holy Spirit, both to the married, and unmarried;<pb n="449" facs="tcp:98258:238"/>to Virgins, and to all thoſe that have exercis'd themſelves in keeping a clean and holy Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both in Body and Mind. And although all theſe Twelve Fruits of the Holy Spirit are owing to his Infinite Bounty; yet this of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity is ſo more than all the reſt; for if, as we have ſaid, none can have that former degree of Chaſtity, out by the Gift of God, <hi>Nemo enim continens eſſe poteſt, niſi Deus dederit;</hi> how can any one by other means obtain this Flower of Chaſtity, which is the Crown and Fruit of that excellent Vertue, which honours and improves even Chaſtity itſelf, being exercis'd in ſuch occaſions, and with ſuch Heroical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as do much increaſe the Glory of it? Nor does the dependance of this Admirable Vertue upon the Bounty of God more than others, increaſe the difficulty of it; for in my Opinion, and according to my way of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it is ſo much the better to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, becauſe it depends upon his moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hand. We ought never to think our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Happineſs more ſecure, than when it is in the hand of God; and if I could forſake what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have, or can have, and utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, and give it up to his moſt bleſſed hands, without returning to ask it again, I would renounce it only that I might depend totally and abſolutely upon ſuch liberal hands. It is clear, that all our Ruine and Deſtruction depends only upon our own Weakneſs and Miſery; and that all our Strength and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends only upon God: And therefore
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:98258:239"/>one of the Reaſons, why Chaſtity is poſſible, is becauſe it depends more upon the Bounty of the Lord than other Vertues, for if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only upon our ſelves, there would be no ſuch thing as Chaſtity in the World. We are weak, wretched, and miſerable Veſſels, filled with Paſſions; and ſo of our ſelves we can neither receive, nor keep thoſe Treaſures which God beſtows upon us. Even our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, though continually defended and aſſiſted by Grace, (without which we could not make ſo much as one ſtep in Goodneſs) is every moment chooſing the worſt; and having E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life on the one hand, and an Eternal Death on the other, we embrace Death, and turn our backs upon Eternal Life. What therefore would become of Chaſtity, that high Gift, if we depended upon our ſelves, and it were not given us from above? Thus though all depend upon God, yet chiefly the Gift of Chaſtity, this moſt ſweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fruit. The Grace of entertaining holy Thoughts, is his; that of flying the Occaſions that are dangerous, and of loving this unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vertue, is from his Favour; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and perſevering in it, all proceeds from his Powerful Hand. Therefore thou oughteſt with great care to ſtrive to follow the Chaſt Motions of his Holy Spirit, to avoid all Places and Companies that may be dangerous, endeavouring to ſubdue and mortifie thy ſelf, earneſtly praying to God for his Favour, and acknowledging that if his Divine Majeſty give<pb n="451" facs="tcp:98258:239"/>it not, there is nothing in thy ſelf but Miſery and Deſtruction, and that all thy Good, thy Remedy, and thy Chaſtity conſiſts only in his Grace, Mercy, and Goodneſs.</p>

                  <head>Of Perſeverance, and Prayer to God.</head>
                  <p>O That I had theſe Gifts! O that I might die with theſe Vertues of the Spiritual Year! O that I were able to ſpend my Hours, my Days, my Weeks, my Months, and my Years in this ſafe Doctrine!</p>
                  <p>Be not diſcouraged, do but go on; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and call upon God in Prayer, for that is all thy Remedy. Conſtancy, Perſeverance, and Continuance in Prayer obtain all things. <hi>Many run,</hi> ſays St.
<hi>Paul, but one alone wins the Prize:</hi> Many Vertues run in the Spiritual Life, many are exerciſed and practiſed, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Crown is given only to Perſeverance; without that Gift the reſt will profit nothing. Take notice what our Saviour ſays, <hi>That if we ſeek, we ſhall find; if we ask, he will give us; and if we knock, he will open unto us.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he tells you it ſucceeded to the Man, that awakened his Friend to borrow three Loaves, by reaſon that a Stranger was come<pb n="452" facs="tcp:98258:240"/>into his Houſe; he came unſeaſonably to him, diſturbing his Reſt in the Night; yet he let him have them, becauſe of his Importunity, which without that he would not have done for his Friendſhip. Remember the poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that perſiſted earneſtly to beg of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judge, who careleſly delayed to diſpatch her buſineſs; her Importunity did more than the Right of her Cauſe, for that overcame his Sloth, when this was not at all regarded. Call to mind that Chriſt ſays, <hi>If a Son impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes his Father for an Egg, he will not give him a Scorpion, but the thing he deſires.</hi> All theſe Compariſons our Saviour ſets before us, to the end we may perſevere, and not faint, nor turn back again to ſlothfulneſs, but that we ſhould ſtill pray, and beg, and call, and cry, for at laſt he will hear us. <hi>He that puts his hand to the Plow, and looks back, is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> What, ſhall he loſe it only for looking back? In but looking back, there is great danger of loſing it. Haſt thou not ſeen it in <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, who only by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back towards
<hi>Sodom,</hi> was turned into a Pillar of Salt, to ſeaſon us by her Puniſhment, and to give us warning, not to do as ſhe did? Having once renounced the World, and its Vanities, we muſt not ſo much as think upon them with delight, or trouble for having left them; for this is a looking back. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vertues and Perfections! how many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Holineſs, have fallen by looking back, and not preſſing on conſtantly forward
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:98258:240"/>to the Mark of our high Calling? What lofty Trees, and tall Cedars of <hi>Libanus</hi> have fallen at the feet of little Shrubs?</p>
                  <p>Remember <hi>Solomon,</hi> more Rich in Gifts than in Wealth. Remember <hi>Judas</hi> the Apoſtle, choſen of God for one of the firm Pillars of his Church. Look upon <hi>Origen,</hi> the Maſter of Chriſtian Inſtruction, and upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a ſtout Defender of the Faith, and the Terror of Hereticks: What wonderful, what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Falls were theirs? How fair, how ſafe, how excellent were their beginnings, and their progreſs! But how unfortunate, how ſad, how doubtful their concluſions! Whence all that Miſchief, whence all thoſe great Misfortunes? Becauſe they perſevered not, they continued not inſtant in Prayer. They grew weary of asking, and of well-doing. They truſted in themſelves, who ſhould only have put their truſt in God, and been fearful of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is clear, that in <hi>Solomon</hi> there began at firſt ſome ſecret thought, and that his Wiſdom was ſo high, that he either made no reckoning of it in the beginning, or that being ſo Wiſe a Man, he found out ſome plauſible Reaſons to bring Idolatrous Queens into his Houſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that in regard of his great Holineſs and Learning, there could not be ſo great danger for him, as for others; nor that cauſe in him to avoid it, which mov'd God to forbid his People the taking of Women of another Religion: He preſumes, being a Man that uſed to ſpeak with God, he ſhould never ſuffer himſelf to<pb n="454" facs="tcp:98258:241"/>be perſwaded by them; but rather that he ſhould convert them, and gain their Souls, by drawing them over to the Worſhip of the true God: But they were more powerful with their Beauty and Allurements, than <hi>Solomon</hi> with all his Eloquence; and their Perſwaſions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him and all his Wiſdom. Then he found Reaſons to allow them Temples only for themſelves at firſt, and within a while by Idolizing them, he became an Idolater with them in that Temple of the Devil. O how great a Fire was kindled from one Spark! Shut thine Eyes, and thine Ears againſt all Evil, cut off the firſt thoughts, and firſt beginnings of it; make haſt from the path of Deſtruction, and from whatſoever may draw thee near to any thing that is evil; and if thou wilt be ſafe, look upon the danger of a Miſchief, with the ſame fear, and with the ſame hatred, that thou lookeſt upon the Miſchief itſelf.</p>
                  <p>How wiſe and cautious were the <hi>Recabites,</hi> who being forbidden by their fore-fathers to drink Wine, would never ſo much as eat Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, and why? Becauſe Raiſins are made of Grapes, and of thoſe Grapes, Wine; and they fear'd, that by eating dry Grapes, they might be tempted to eat ripe Grapes; and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to ſqueeze out the Juice to make Wine and from making Wine at laſt to come to the drinking of it. Thus it concerns thee to be careful never to turn back from the way of God, neither with thy Sight, no, nor with thy Hearing, nor with any other of thy Senſes,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:98258:241"/>or Faculties. Walk ſtill forward without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; for not to go forward, is to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If thou giveſt but one of thy Senſes up to danger, by that it will gain thy whole Soul with all its Senſes, Powers, and Faculties. <hi>David</hi> did not give up his Heart to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor his Underſtanding, Will, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; nor his Hearing with the reſt of his Senſes and Faculties; No, no; he gave only a Glance, he did but look upon <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and having only allowed that nimble Senſe to the hazard, by it the Devil caught him, and ſo gain'd his Underſtanding, Will, and Memory, with all the reſt of his Senſes, Powers, and Faculties, and triumphed a whole Year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over that poor King, who afterwards did no ſmall matter to make his eſcape out of that Slavery, and to reſcue himſelf by the force of Penitential Tears, after the ſuffering of many great Afflictions. To God all muſt be given, all that thou haſt, without reſerving any thing whatſoever; for he is the Lord of all, from whom thou haſt received all thou haſt. To the Common Enemy allow not ſo much as the ſmalleſt ſhare imaginable; for if any thing be given him, how little ſoever it be, that may be the occaſion of very great Miſchiefs. When
<hi>Moſes</hi> contended with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> about letting the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> go, that Barbarous King ſeeing his Power, contented himſelf with leſs and leſs in every Capitulation, and came lower and lower from one demand to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, only that ſomething might remain in his
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:98258:242"/>poſſeſſion, that belonged to the People of God, hoping by that means to find out an Excuſe to keep them ſtill his Captives; but Reſolute <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſtood firmly to his firſt demand, and would not make him the leaſt abatement, telling him finally, <hi>That there ſhould not remain ſo much as a hoof of the ſmalleſt Beaſt that belonged to any</hi> Iſraelite, <hi>but that all, abſolutely all, ſhould go out of</hi> Egypt. This Example thou muſt follow; leave nothing, nothing at all to the Devil, but give all; all is little enough to be given to God. The Tyrant contents himſelf with a very little at firſt, knowing how probable it is, that from ſuch ſmall beginnings, he ſhall make himſelf Maſter of all at laſt. In his firſt attempt he ſeems very modeſt, and makes as if he thought all were too much, but in the end he thinks all too little. How many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been loſt, and taken by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at the entrance of a very ſmall Breach, or of ſome little hole, or narrow paſſage, that has been neglected, or leſs carefully guarded? We have often ſeen, that at ſome little Wicket or Cleft in a Wall, where a Man could hardly put in his hand, the Enemies with very little Induſtry have made Paſſages for whole Armies to enter. Therefore after ſo many Vertues, which I have ſet before thine Eyes, I eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recommend theſe two, Vigilance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; for they are the moſt ſerviceable for the obtaining the Gift of Perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:98258:242"/>Conſider well what it is that may ſeparate thee from God; obſerve it with Vigilance, and fly from it with Diligence. Be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, do not ſleep, for then thou wilt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with Enemies, and with that <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion,</hi> as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> calls him, <hi>who goes about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Pray ſtill, for by Prayer thou ſhalt obtain Perſeverance. That important Gift depends wholly upon God; it is he that gives it, to him thou muſt owe it, and it cannot be merited in this Life, though in it it may be obtained. By how much the more this Gift of Perſeverance depends upon God, with ſo much the greater, and the more repeated Inſtances oughteſt thou to beg it of him, and to ſtrive to win him by fervent Love, by Prayers, Tears, and Contrition.</p>
                  <p>O Father, that I could but know, whether or no I ſhall Perſevere in the Spiritual Life! O that I were ſure that I ſhould be ſo happy, as never to turn back from it! With what Comfort, and with what Joy and Gladneſs ſhould I ſerve God?</p>
                  <p>But do not deſire, nor ſearch to know, what thy end ſhall be. Be careful to learn thy Duty, and to perform it; be careful to ſerve and to pleaſe God, and if thou doſt ſo, hope aſſuredly; for if thy Life be Vertuous and Pious, the end of it will be Perſeverance. Endeavour to ſpend thy days in Holy and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Employments, and thou mayeſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently truſt in the Divine Goodneſs, that thy Death ſhall be ſuch as thy Life hath been.<pb n="458" facs="tcp:98258:243"/>What canſt thou get by knowing what will become of thee in the other Life? To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and grow careleſs, if they tell thee thou ſhalt be ſaved; or to be diſcouraged, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, if they ſay thou ſhalt be damned; In which deſperate condition it is impoſſible thou ſhouldſt be ſaved; and in the other by Pride and Negligence, thou muſt neceſſarily be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Wilt thou have me tell thee, what will become of thee and me in the other Life, and whether we ſhall be damned, or ſaved? Then let us both obſerve how we live, and what our Actions are in this Life, for according to them it ſhall befal us in the other. This is moſt certain, no good Man was ever condemned, nor evil Man ſaved, while they continued to be ſuch. If thou liveſt well, hope, and truſt in God, that he will ſave thee; but if ill, and doſt not amend, thou mayeſt be certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, thou ſhalt be condemned. All thou ſhalt deſire to know beyond this, will bring thee into great danger either of Diſtruſt, or Vanity, but can no ways be profitable unto thy Soul. Believe and think worthily of God, for he is Goodneſs itſelf. Canſt thou poſſibly think, that his Infinite Mercy will let thee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if thou ſerveſt him? Canſt thou think, if thou beggeſt of him, that he will deny to Pardon thee, who doſt confeſs and adore him during thy Life? He that at his Death begged Pardon for thoſe that were Crucifying of him? If thou and I do all we can to pleaſe him, though we are weak, though we are ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,<pb n="459" facs="tcp:98258:243"/>what will not God, who is Soveraign Goodneſs, and Super-abundant in Mercy, do for thoſe that ſtrive all they can to pleaſe him? But on the contrary, if we offend and provoke him to wrath, and do neither humble our ſelves, nor ask Pardon, what can we hope for from a Juſt and an Almighty Lord, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and provoked? Let us caſt away and forſake our Evil, and then be certain, that in God we ſhall find nothing but Goodneſs and Pity. Let us throw down our Arms, and caſt away thoſe Weapons, wherewith we have fought againſt him; let us fall proſtrate at his Feet, and not be ſo fooliſh, as to fight againſt an Omnipotent God; and if we ceaſe to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, Repenting, and bewailing our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evil ways; God who is ſtrict, ſevere, and rigorous to the Wicked, will be found gracious, ſweet, and merciful to the Penitent. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainly known in this Life, what will become of a Soul in the other; but we may well conjecture, and I would have thee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern thy Life by that, which may probably be conjectured, and not weary and diſtract thy ſelf in ſeeking after certain Proofs of that which cannot poſſibly be known.</p>
                  <p>If I ſee a Man that fears God, that loves and ſerves him, that frequents the Sacrament, that is conſtant in Prayer, that often recollects himſelf to think of Eternity, that is kind to the Poor, and forward to relieve them; that hears the Word of God with Humility and Delight, and who, if through frailty he falls<pb n="460" facs="tcp:98258:244"/>ſometimes, preſently ſeeks to God for Pardon, with Penitent Tears humbling himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſins, and flying from the occaſions of them; I dare be bold to conjecture and to hope, nay, to be well aſſured in the Divine Goodneſs, that the Soul of that Man will not fail to be ſaved. But if on the other ſide, I ſee one forgetful of Eternity, regardleſs of Heavenly things, much given to the Pleaſures, and Honours, and Riches of this World, full of Vices and Paſſions, without any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Death or Judgment, Heaven or Hell, making it his only buſineſs to delight and to entertain himſelf, to eat and drink with Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and Exceſs, and that does no right to others, nor will ſuffer any the leaſt wrong done to himſelf; I cannot but fear upon theſe grounds, that he will not eſcape Damnation; and I neither hold that to be Preſumption, nor this raſh Judgment; for that is an Holy Hope, which we ought to have in the Divine Goodneſs and Mercy; and this a Pious Doubt and Fear, which is due to the Divine Juſtice. This manner of Conjecture is taught us by the Holy Scripture, and therefore it cannot be an evil thing; for I ſee that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a poor humble Beggar, that bore his Miſeries with Patience, was ſav'd; and I ſee the rich hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Glutton, who fared deliciouſly, and wallowed in his Vices, was condemned. Now, how ſhould I frame my Conjecture, but by the Experience of what I have ſeen? I ſee <hi>Judas,</hi> deſpairing of God's Mercy after his Fall,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:98258:244"/>was condemned; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> after his, by weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repenting, was ſaved; and muſt I not needs gather from thence, that he who diſtruſts God's Mercy, will be condemned; and he that begs it, and truſts in it, will be ſav'd? I ſee, <hi>Saul,</hi> who made no reckoning of his ſins, was condemned; and I ſee <hi>David,</hi> who lamented and forſook his, was ſaved. Muſt I not needs collect from hence, that he who regards not, and is not concerned for an evil Life, will moſt probably have an evil Death; and that he will have a good one, who turns from his evil ways, and amends them during his Life? I ſee Covetous <hi>Cain</hi> condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was Covetous, and repented not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Covetouſneſs; and I ſee Liberal <hi>Abel</hi> ſaved, becauſe he frankly offered to God of the Fruits of his Flock. From hence I muſt neceſſarily think, that he who denies or grudges to beſtow part of thoſe Goods in the Service of God, which he received from him, is going in the broad Path of Deſtruction; but he that gives chearfully and bountifully to the Poor, and by returning that part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that he has received all from a more Liberal Hand, is going in the right and certain way to Heaven, where he ſhall receive an hundred fold, and be eternally Crowned.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I ſee nothing elſe in the Scripture, but Examples of the good, that are ſaved; and of the wicked, that are damned; and that the Gift of final Perſeverance, is given by God to thoſe at their Death, who by their conſtant<pb n="462" facs="tcp:98258:245"/>Prayers, and Good Works, have made it their endeavour to obtain it, during the courſe of their Life. That Prodigy of the World, the good Thief, who eſcap'd from Shipwrack at his Death upon the Plank of the Croſs, was an inſtance of the extraordinary Power of Grace, and one of thoſe ſtrange Wonders that concurred at the Crucifying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. It was like the tremblings of the Earth, and the cleavings of the Rocks; like the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Vail of the Temple, and the Dead breaking out of their Sepulchres, to return to life; like the darkning of the Sun, and the diſturbance of the whole Frame of Nature. Amongſt theſe and other Prodigies, that great Wonder may juſtly be reckoned, that he ſhould die a Saint, who had been a Thief during the whole courſe of his Life, till that moment. And obſerve, that though there were many Graves that opened, and many that aroſe from the Dead; many Rocks that were cleft, many Lights that were darkened, and many Signs, that manifeſted the Power and Efficacy of the Death of Chriſt; there was but one of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion at the laſt gaſp. And though the Lord Jeſus had another Thief as near him, to whom he might have ſhewed the ſame Mercy; yet he ſuffered him to die in his Impenitency, and to go to the Devil. The very words which Jeſus ſpake when he ſaved the good Thief, do contain a warning, that no Man may venture to delay his Repentance till his Death; for he ſaid, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee, this day ſhalt</hi>
                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:98258:245"/>
                     <hi>thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> All which words ſeem to be full of Limitations.
<hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee,</hi> is, as it were, a kind of Oath; for a thing ſo admirable, as the ſaving of a Man at his Death, who had all his Life-time been a Thief, and a wicked Perſon, ſeemed to ſtand in need of an Oath for to make it be believed. I ſay unto thee is added, as who ſhould ſay, Do not believe others, if they ſhould ſay, it is eaſie for thoſe to be ſav'd, who delay their Repentance till their Death; No, that is no eaſie matter; but I will now at this time make that eaſie for thee, which elſe doth ſeem impoſſible; as if he had limited that Grace then unto that Soul, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his Body in the ſight of his dying Saviour. <hi>I ſay unto thee</hi> now, for as for others, I ſhall ſee hereafter, how I ſhall deal with them. <hi>This day,</hi> that is, this day of ſo great Mercy; this day, a day of ſo many Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; this day, when I deſire to ſhew how far my Grace and Mercy can extend; for other days, I ſhall refer them to my Juſtice, and to the Occaſion. <hi>Thou ſhalt be with me;</hi> thou that dyeſt with me, ſhalt go with me; but if thou hadſt not kept me Company in Death, thou ſhouldſt not have kept me Company in Paradiſe. All which are rare Singularities, which, if they do not ſhorten the Power of God, and his Grace towards others, yet St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> notes, that they may well make Man's Preſumption tremble. Finally, we have more reaſon to fear in this caſe God's Juſtice, for
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:98258:246"/>that the other Thief was not ſav'd, (though he was ſo near our Saviour) becauſe he had delayed his Repentance till Death; than to be too confident of his Mercy, who ſaved the good Thief with ſo many limitations.</p>
                  <p>What is all this, but to warn us to do well, while we live, and enjoy our Youth, our Health, and our Strength; and not to defer our Amendment till the hour of our Death? And to make us obſerve, that good living, and good dying go together, and that evil living, and evil dying do ſo too; and that to expect thoſe Miracles when we die, which only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the Death of our Saviour, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making him our Friend, while we live, moſt certainly provoke him to be our Enemy at our Death, and Judgment. Thus Good Works are the probable Signs of a good Death to follow; and an ill Death is the ſign of Evil Works, which went before.</p>
